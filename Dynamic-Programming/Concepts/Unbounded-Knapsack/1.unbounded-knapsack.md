# Intuition
The problem is an unbounded knapsack problem, where we can include an item multiple times to maximize the total value while respecting the weight capacity. The intuition is to use a recursive approach to explore all possible combinations of including and excluding items.

# Approach
1. Define a recursive function `knapSackRecursive` that takes the number of items `n`, the weight capacity `W`, the array of item values `val`, and the array of item weights `wt` as parameters.
2. In the base case, if there are no items (`n == 0`) or the capacity is 0 (`W == 0`), return 0 since no items can be included.
3. If the weight of the current item (`wt[n - 1]`) is greater than the remaining capacity (`W`), exclude the current item and recursively solve the problem for the remaining items.
4. Otherwise, we have two choices:
   - Include the current item: Add the value of the current item (`val[n - 1]`) to the maximum value obtained by recursively solving the problem for the remaining capacity (`W - wt[n - 1]`). Since it's an unbounded knapsack, we can include the same item multiple times, so we pass `n` instead of `n - 1` in the recursive call.
   - Exclude the current item: Recursively solve the problem for the remaining items by passing `n - 1`.
5. Return the maximum of the two choices using `Math.max()`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
$$O(2^n)$$, where n is the number of items. In the worst case, the recursive solution explores all possible combinations of including and excluding items, leading to an exponential time complexity.

- Space complexity:
$$O(n)$$ for the recursive call stack. The maximum depth of the recursion is equal to the number of items.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    static int knapSack(int n, int W, int val[], int wt[]) {
        return knapSackRecursive(n, W, val, wt);
    }

    static int knapSackRecursive(int n, int W, int val[], int wt[]) {
        // Base case: if there are no items or the capacity is 0
        if (n == 0 || W == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        // If the weight of the current item is greater than the remaining capacity,
        // exclude the current item
        if (wt[n - 1] > W) {
            return knapSackRecursive(n - 1, W, val, wt);
        }

        // Return the maximum of two cases:
        // 1. Include the current item and recursively solve for the remaining items and capacity
        // 2. Exclude the current item and recursively solve for the remaining items
        return Math.max(
            val[n - 1] + knapSackRecursive(n, W - wt[n - 1], val, wt),
            knapSackRecursive(n - 1, W, val, wt)
        );
    }
}
```

The code implements the recursive solution as described in the approach. The `knapSack` function serves as a wrapper to call the recursive `knapSackRecursive` function with the given parameters. The `knapSackRecursive` function handles the base cases, checks if the current item can be included, and recursively solves the problem for the remaining items and capacity. Finally, it returns the maximum value obtained by either including or excluding the current item.
