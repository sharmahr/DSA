# Intuition
The longest common subsequence (LCS) problem involves finding the length of the longest subsequence that is common to both strings. The intuition is to compare characters from both strings and make decisions based on whether they match or not. If the characters match, we include them in the subsequence; otherwise, we explore two possibilities: either exclude the character from the first string or exclude the character from the second string.

# Approach
1. Define a recursive function `lcs` that takes the lengths of the two strings (`x` and `y`) and the strings themselves (`s1` and `s2`) as parameters.
2. In the base case, if either string is empty (i.e., `x == 0` or `y == 0`), return 0 since no common subsequence can be formed.
3. Initialize a variable `length` to store the length of the longest common subsequence.
4. Compare the characters at the current positions (`s1.charAt(x-1)` and `s2.charAt(y-1)`):
   - If the characters match, increment `length` by 1 and recursively call `lcs` with the positions moved one step back in both strings (`x-1` and `y-1`).
   - If the characters do not match, recursively call `lcs` with two possibilities:
     - Exclude the character from the first string (`x-1`) and keep the position in the second string (`y`).
     - Exclude the character from the second string (`y-1`) and keep the position in the first string (`x`).
   - Update `length` with the maximum value returned by the recursive calls.
5. Return the final value of `length`, which represents the length of the longest common subsequence.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
$$O(2^{x+y})$$, where `x` and `y` are the lengths of the two strings. In the worst case, the recursive solution explores all possible combinations of including and excluding characters from both strings, leading to an exponential time complexity.

- Space complexity:
$$O(x+y)$$ for the recursive call stack. The maximum depth of the recursion is equal to the sum of the lengths of the two strings.

# Code
```java
class Solution
{
    //Function to find the length of longest common subsequence in two strings.
    static int lcs(int x, int y, String s1, String s2)
    {
       // return the length of the longest common subsequence
       if (x == 0 || y == 0) return 0;
       int length = 0;
       if(s1.charAt(x-1) == s2.charAt(y-1)){
           length += 1;
           length += lcs(x-1, y-1, s1, s2);
       }else{
           length += Math.max(lcs(x-1, y, s1, s2),lcs(x, y-1, s1, s2));
       }
       
       return length;
    }
    
}
```

The code implements the recursive solution as described in the approach. The `lcs` function takes the lengths of the two strings (`x` and `y`) and the strings themselves (`s1` and `s2`) as parameters. It handles the base case when either string is empty, compares the characters at the current positions, and recursively calls itself based on whether the characters match or not. The recursive calls explore the possibilities of including or excluding characters from both strings. Finally, it returns the length of the longest common subsequence.

Note: The recursive solution has an exponential time complexity and may lead to redundant calculations. To optimize the solution, dynamic programming techniques such as memoization or tabulation can be used to avoid recomputing the same subproblems and reduce the time complexity to $$O(xy)$$.
