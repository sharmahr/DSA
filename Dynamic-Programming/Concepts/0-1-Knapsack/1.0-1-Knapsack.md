# Intuition
The given code is a recursive solution to the 0/1 Knapsack problem. The problem statement is to find the maximum value that can be put in a knapsack of capacity W, given a set of items with weights and values. The intuition behind the recursive approach is to consider two possibilities at each step: either include the current item in the knapsack or exclude it, and choose the one that maximizes the total value.

# Approach
The recursive approach follows these steps:
1. Base case: If the number of items is zero or the knapsack capacity is zero, return 0 as no further items can be added.
2. If the weight of the current item is less than or equal to the remaining knapsack capacity, we have two options:
   - Include the current item: Add the value of the current item to the result of the recursive call with the remaining capacity and remaining items.
   - Exclude the current item: Recursively solve the subproblem with the same remaining capacity and remaining items.
   Choose the maximum of the above two options.
3. If the weight of the current item exceeds the remaining knapsack capacity, we cannot include it. Recursively solve the subproblem with the same remaining capacity and remaining items.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
$$O(2^n)$$, where n is the number of items. In the worst case, the recursive function explores all possible subsets of items, resulting in exponential time complexity.

- Space complexity:
$$O(n)$$ due to the recursive calls on the stack. The maximum depth of the recursion is n, where n is the number of items.

# Code
```java
class Solution { 
    //Function to return max value that can be put in knapsack of capacity W.
    static int knapSack(int W, int wt[], int val[], int n) 
    { 
        if(n == 0 || W == 0) return 0; //base condition
        if(wt[n-1] <= W) {
            return Math.max(val[n-1]+knapSack(W-wt[n-1], wt, val, n-1), knapSack(W, wt, val, n-1));
        }
        
        if(wt[n-1] > W){
            return knapSack(W, wt, val, n-1);
        }
        return 0;
    }
}
```

Note: The given recursive solution has exponential time complexity, which can be optimized using dynamic programming techniques such as memoization or tabulation to avoid redundant calculations and improve the time complexity to $$O(nW)$$.
