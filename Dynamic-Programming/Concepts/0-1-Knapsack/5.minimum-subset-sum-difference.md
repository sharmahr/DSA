# Intuition
The given code solves the Minimum Subset Sum Difference problem using dynamic programming. The problem statement is to partition a given set of integers into two subsets such that the absolute difference between the sums of the two subsets is minimum. The intuition behind the solution is to use a 2D DP table to determine if a subset with a particular sum exists and then find the minimum difference among all possible subset sums.

# Approach
The approach to solve the Minimum Subset Sum Difference problem is as follows:
1. Calculate the total sum of all elements in the array.
2. Create a 2D DP table `t` of size `(N+1) x (sum+1)`, where `N` is the number of elements in the array and `sum` is the total sum.
3. Initialize the base cases:
   - Set `t[i][0] = true` for all `i` from 0 to `N`, as an empty subset can always have a sum of 0.
   - Set `t[0][i] = false` for all `i` from 1 to `sum`, as an empty array cannot have a non-zero sum.
4. Fill the DP table using the following recurrence relation:
   - If `arr[i-1] <= j`, then `t[i][j] = t[i-1][j-arr[i-1]] || t[i-1][j]`.
   - Else, `t[i][j] = t[i-1][j]`.
5. After filling the DP table, iterate from 0 to `sum/2` and find the maximum sum `i` for which `t[N][i]` is true.
6. Calculate the minimum difference as `sum - (2 * i)`.
7. Return the minimum difference.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
$$O(N \times sum)$$, where `N` is the number of elements in the array and `sum` is the total sum of all elements. The DP table is filled once for each cell, resulting in a total of `(N+1) x (sum+1)` iterations.

- Space complexity:
$$O(N \times sum)$$ to store the 2D DP table of size `(N+1) x (sum+1)`.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int minDifference(int arr[], int N) { 
        // code here
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i : arr) {
            sum += i;
        }
        
        // now the problem is reduced to subset sum
        boolean[][] t = new boolean[N+1][sum+1];
        
        for (int i = 0; i <= N; i++) {
            t[i][0] = true;
        }
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= sum; i++) {
            t[0][i] = false;
        }
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= sum; j++) {
                if (arr[i-1] <= j) {
                    t[i][j] = t[i-1][j-arr[i-1]] || t[i-1][j];
                } else {
                    t[i][j] = t[i-1][j];
                }
            }
        }
        
        // check the minimum value
        int minimum = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i <= (sum/2); i++) {
            if (t[N][i]) {
                minimum = Math.min(minimum, sum - (2*i));
            }
        }
        return minimum;
    }
}
```

The code uses a bottom-up dynamic programming approach to fill the DP table and determine if a subset with a particular sum exists. It then finds the minimum difference among all possible subset sums by iterating from 0 to `sum/2` and checking the maximum sum `i` for which `t[N][i]` is true. The minimum difference is calculated as `sum - (2 * i)`.
