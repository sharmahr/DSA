# Intuition
The given code solves the Target Sum problem using recursion. The problem statement is to find the number of ways to assign positive and negative signs to the elements of an array such that the sum of the array equals the given target. The intuition behind the solution is to convert the problem into a subset sum problem and then use recursion to solve it.

# Approach
The approach to solve the Target Sum problem is as follows:
1. Calculate the sum of all elements in the array and add the target value to it.
2. If the sum is odd, return 0 as it is not possible to partition the array into two subsets with the given target.
3. Divide the sum by 2 to get the new target sum.
4. Use a recursive helper function `helper(n, arr, sum)` to find the number of subsets with the new target sum.
   - Base cases:
     - If `sum` is 0 and `n` is 0, return 1 as an empty subset can have a sum of 0.
     - If `n` is 0, return 0 as an empty array cannot have a non-zero sum.
   - Recursive cases:
     - If `arr[n-1] <= sum`, recursively solve the subproblem by either including or excluding the current element.
     - Else, recursively solve the subproblem by excluding the current element.
5. Return the result obtained from the helper function.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
$$O(2^n)$$, where `n` is the number of elements in the array. In the worst case, the recursive function explores all possible subsets of elements, resulting in exponential time complexity.

- Space complexity:
$$O(n)$$ due to the recursive calls on the stack. The maximum depth of the recursion is `n`, where `n` is the number of elements in the array.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    static int findTargetSumWays(int n, int[] arr, int target) {
        // code here
        int sum = target;
        for (int i : arr) {
            sum += i;
        }
        
        if (sum % 2 != 0) return 0;
        sum /= 2;
        return helper(n, arr, sum);
    }
    
    private static int helper(int n, int[] arr, int sum) {
        if (sum == 0 && n == 0) return 1;
        if (n == 0) return 0;
        
        if (arr[n-1] <= sum) {
            return helper(n-1, arr, sum-arr[n-1]) + helper(n-1, arr, sum);
        } else {
            return helper(n-1, arr, sum);
        }
    }
}
```

The code first calculates the sum of all elements in the array and adds the target value to it. If the sum is odd, it returns 0 as it is not possible to partition the array into two subsets with the given target. Otherwise, it divides the sum by 2 to get the new target sum.

The code then uses a recursive helper function `helper(n, arr, sum)` to find the number of subsets with the new target sum. It handles the base cases and recursively solves the subproblems by either including or excluding the current element based on its value.

Note: The given recursive solution has exponential time complexity, which can be optimized using dynamic programming techniques such as memoization or tabulation to avoid redundant calculations and improve the time complexity to $$O(n \times sum)$$.
