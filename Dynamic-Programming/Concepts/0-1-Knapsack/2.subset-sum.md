# Intuition
The given code is a recursive solution to the Subset Sum problem. The problem statement is to determine if there exists a subset of elements in an array that sum up to a given target sum. The intuition behind the recursive approach is to consider two possibilities at each step: either include the current element in the subset or exclude it, and recursively solve the subproblems.

# Approach
The recursive approach follows these steps:
1. Base cases:
   - If the target sum becomes zero, return true as we have found a subset with the desired sum.
   - If the number of elements becomes zero, return false as we have exhausted all elements without finding a subset with the desired sum.
2. If the value of the current element is less than or equal to the remaining target sum, we have two options:
   - Include the current element: Recursively solve the subproblem with the remaining elements and the updated target sum (subtracting the current element's value from the sum).
   - Exclude the current element: Recursively solve the subproblem with the remaining elements and the same target sum.
   Return true if either of the above recursive calls returns true.
3. If the value of the current element is greater than the remaining target sum, we cannot include it. Recursively solve the subproblem with the remaining elements and the same target sum.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
$$O(2^n)$$, where n is the number of elements in the array. In the worst case, the recursive function explores all possible subsets of elements, resulting in exponential time complexity.

- Space complexity:
$$O(n)$$ due to the recursive calls on the stack. The maximum depth of the recursion is n, where n is the number of elements in the array.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    // try the recursive solution first
    static Boolean isSubsetSum(int n, int arr[], int sum) {
        if (sum == 0)
            return true;
        if (n == 0)
            return false;
        
        if (arr[n-1] <= sum) {
            return isSubsetSum(n-1, arr, sum-arr[n-1]) || isSubsetSum(n-1, arr, sum);
        } else {
            return isSubsetSum(n-1, arr, sum);
        }
    }
}
```

Note: The given recursive solution has exponential time complexity, which can be optimized using dynamic programming techniques such as memoization or tabulation to avoid redundant calculations and improve the time complexity to $$O(n \times sum)$$.
