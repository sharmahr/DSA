# Intuition
The given code solves the Perfect Sum problem using dynamic programming. The problem statement is to find the number of subsets of an array with a given sum. The intuition behind the solution is to use a 2D DP table to store the count of subsets with different sums for different numbers of elements.

# Approach
The approach to solve the Perfect Sum problem is as follows:
1. Create a 2D DP table `t` of size `(n+1) x (sum+1)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the array and `sum` is the target sum.
2. Initialize the base cases:
   - Set `t[0][0] = 1`, as an empty subset can have a sum of 0.
   - Set `t[0][i] = 0` for all `i` from 1 to `sum`, as an empty array cannot have a non-zero sum.
3. Fill the DP table using the following recurrence relation:
   - If `arr[i-1] <= j`, then `t[i][j] = (t[i-1][j-arr[i-1]] + t[i-1][j]) % mod`.
   - Else, `t[i][j] = t[i-1][j] % mod`.
4. Return `t[n][sum]`, which represents the count of subsets with the given sum.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
$$O(n \times sum)$$, where `n` is the number of elements in the array and `sum` is the target sum. The DP table is filled once for each cell, resulting in a total of `(n+1) x (sum+1)` iterations.

- Space complexity:
$$O(n \times sum)$$ to store the 2D DP table of size `(n+1) x (sum+1)`.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int perfectSum(int arr[], int n, int sum) {
        int mod = (int) 1e9 + 7;
        // Your code goes here
        int[][] t = new int[n+1][sum+1];
   
        t[0][0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= sum; i++) {
            t[0][i] = 0;
        }

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= sum; j++) {
                if (arr[i-1] <= j) {
                    t[i][j] = (t[i-1][j-arr[i-1]] + t[i-1][j]) % mod;
                } else {
                    t[i][j] = t[i-1][j] % mod;
                }
            }
        }
        return t[n][sum];
    }
}
```

The code uses a bottom-up dynamic programming approach to fill the DP table and calculate the count of subsets with the given sum. It returns the count modulo `1e9 + 7` to handle large values.

The key steps in the code are:
1. Initialize the DP table with base cases.
2. Fill the DP table using the recurrence relation.
3. Return the value at `t[n][sum]`, which represents the count of subsets with the given sum.

The code handles large values by taking the modulo of the counts with `1e9 + 7` to avoid overflow.
