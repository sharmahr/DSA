# Dynamic Programming

Identifying Dynamic Programming (DP) Questions:
- Look for optimal substructure: the optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of subproblems.
- Check for overlapping subproblems: the same subproblems are solved multiple times.
- Consider if memoization or tabulation can be applied to optimize the solution.
- Identify optimization problems that ask for minimum cost, maximum profit, shortest path, or longest subsequence.
- The constraints of the problem will be in the range of 100 to 1000

Building Intuition for DP:
- Start with small examples and identify patterns and relationships between subproblems.
- Analyze the problem structure, decision points, and optimal substructure.
- Express the problem as a recursive formula or recurrence relation.
- Implement the solution using memoization (top-down) or tabulation (bottom-up).
- Practice solving various DP problems and recognize common patterns.
- Analyze time and space complexity of the DP solution.

Remember, building intuition for DP requires practice and exposure to different problems. Start with simpler problems and gradually increase the complexity to develop a strong understanding of DP techniques.
