| Problem | Notes | Solution |
|:-------------|:--------------:|-------------:|
| [Construct String from Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-string-from-binary-tree/description/) | Perform a preorder traversal of the tree and append the node values to the string. We need to include parentheses to represent the structure of the tree and handle the cases where a node has only a right child or no children. | Row 3, Cell 3 |
| [Lowest Common Ancestor of Binary Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/description/) | In a BST, the LCA of two nodes is the node that separates the two nodes in different subtrees, or the node itself if it is one of the two nodes. | Row 3, Cell 3 |
| [Insert into a Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-into-a-binary-search-tree/description/) | In a BST, nodes with values less than the current node are inserted in the left subtree, and nodes with values greater than the current node are inserted in the right subtree. We can recursively traverse the BST and find the appropriate position to insert the new node. | Row 3, Cell 3 |
| [Delete Node in a BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-bst/description/) | The intuition is to recursively traverse the BST to find the node to be deleted and handle different cases based on the number of children the node has. | Row 3, Cell 3 |
