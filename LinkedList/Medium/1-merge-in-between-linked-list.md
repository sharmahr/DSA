[Problem Statement](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-in-between-linked-lists/description/)

# Intuition
The problem requires merging two linked lists by removing a portion of the first list and replacing it with the second list. The intuition is to find the nodes at positions `a` and `b` in the first list, remove the nodes between them, and connect the second list in their place.

# Approach
1. Initialize two pointers, `prev` and `current`, to traverse the first list. `prev` will keep track of the node before the `a`th node, and `current` will be used to iterate through the list.

2. Traverse the first list until the `a`th node is reached. At this point, `prev` will be pointing to the node before the `a`th node.

3. Connect `prev.next` to the head of the second list, effectively removing the nodes between `a` and `b` from the first list.

4. Continue traversing the first list until the `b`th node is reached. At this point, `current` will be pointing to the `b`th node.

5. Traverse the second list until its last node is reached.

6. Connect the last node of the second list to `current.next`, which is the node after the `b`th node in the first list.

7. Set `current.next` to `null` to remove the remaining nodes after the `b`th node in the first list.

8. Return the head of the modified first list.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(a + b + m), where a and b are the positions of the nodes to be removed in the first list, and m is the length of the second list. In the worst case, we need to traverse the first list until the bth node and then traverse the entire second list.

- Space complexity: O(1) as we are using constant extra space to store the pointers and temporary variables.

# Code
```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode mergeInBetween(ListNode list1, int a, int b, ListNode list2) {
        ListNode prev = null;
        ListNode current = list1;
        int index = 0;

        // Find the ath node and its previous node
        while (index < a) {
            prev = current;
            current = current.next;
            index++;
        }

        // Connect prev.next to the head of list2
        prev.next = list2;

        // Find the bth node
        while (index <= b) {
            current = current.next;
            index++;
        }

        // Traverse list2 to its last node
        ListNode temp = list2;
        while (temp.next != null) {
            temp = temp.next;
        }

        // Connect the last node of list2 to current.next
        temp.next = current;

        return list1;
    }
}
```

This solution efficiently merges the two linked lists by removing the specified portion of the first list and replacing it with the second list. The time complexity is linear, and the space complexity is constant.
