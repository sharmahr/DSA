[Problem Statement](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/submissions/1279243578/)

# Intuition
The problem requires reordering a linked list in a specific pattern: the first node, followed by the last node, followed by the second node, followed by the second-to-last node, and so on. The intuition is to split the linked list into two halves, reverse the second half, and then merge the two halves alternately.

# Approach
1. Check if the linked list is empty or contains only one node. In such cases, no reordering is needed, so return.

2. Find the middle of the linked list using the slow and fast pointer technique.
   - Initialize two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, both pointing to the head of the list.
   - Move `slow` one step at a time and `fast` two steps at a time.
   - When `fast` reaches the end or the second-to-last node, `slow` will be at the middle of the list.

3. Split the linked list into two halves.
   - The first half starts from the head and ends at the node pointed to by `slow`.
   - The second half starts from the node next to `slow`.
   - Set `slow.next` to `null` to break the connection between the two halves.

4. Reverse the second half of the linked list.
   - Initialize three pointers: `prev` (initially `null`), `current` (initially the head of the second half), and `temp`.
   - Iterate through the second half, reversing the direction of the pointers.
     - Save the next node of `current` in `temp`.
     - Reverse the `next` pointer of `current` to point to `prev`.
     - Move `prev` to `current`, `current` to `temp`, and continue the iteration.

5. Merge the two halves alternately.
   - Initialize two pointers, `first` (pointing to the head of the first half) and `second` (pointing to the head of the reversed second half).
   - Iterate until either `first` or `second` becomes `null`.
     - Save the next nodes of `first` and `second` in `firstNext` and `secondNext`, respectively.
     - Connect `first.next` to `second`, and `second.next` to `firstNext`.
     - Move `first` to `firstNext` and `second` to `secondNext`.

6. The linked list is now reordered in the desired pattern.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. We traverse the list once to find the middle, once to reverse the second half, and once to merge the two halves.

- Space complexity: O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space to store the pointers.

# Code
```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public void reorderList(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null || head.next == null) {
            return;
        }

        // Find the middle of the linked list
        ListNode slow = head, fast = head;
        while (fast.next != null && fast.next.next != null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }

        // Reverse the second half of the linked list
        ListNode prev = null, current = slow.next;
        while (current != null) {
            ListNode temp = current.next;
            current.next = prev;
            prev = current;
            current = temp;
        }
        slow.next = null;

        // Merge the two halves alternately
        ListNode first = head, second = prev;
        while (second != null) {
            ListNode firstNext = first.next;
            ListNode secondNext = second.next;
            first.next = second;
            second.next = firstNext;
            first = firstNext;
            second = secondNext;
        }
    }
}
```

This solution efficiently reorders the linked list in the desired pattern by splitting the list into two halves, reversing the second half, and merging them alternately. The time complexity is linear, and the space complexity is constant.
