# Arrays And Hashing
| Problem | Notes | Solution |
|:-------------|:--------------:|-------------:|
| [Contains Duplicate](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/description/) | Use the input array itself as a hash table to keep track of the elements we have encountered so far. By negating the value at the index corresponding to each element, we can mark it as visited. If we encounter a negative value at an index, it means we have already visited that element before, indicating a duplicate. | [Solution](https://github.com/sharmahr/DSA/blob/main/Top-150/Arrays-And-Hashing/1-contains-duplicate.md) |
| [Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/description/) | Count the frequency of each character in both strings and compare them or sort the strings and compare. | [Solution](https://github.com/sharmahr/DSA/blob/main/Top-150/Arrays-And-Hashing/2-valid-anagram.md) |
| [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) | Use a hashmap to store the elements of the array along with their indices | [Solution](https://github.com/sharmahr/DSA/blob/main/Top-150/Arrays-And-Hashing/3-two-sum.md) |
| [Group Anagrams](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/) | Use a hashmap where the key is a sorted version of each word, and the value is a list of words that are anagrams of each other | [Solution](https://github.com/sharmahr/DSA/blob/main/Top-150/Arrays-And-Hashing/4-group-anagrams.md) |
| [Top K frequent Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/) | use a hash map to count the frequency of each element and then use a priority queue (min-heap) to keep track of the top k frequent elements. | [Solution](https://github.com/sharmahr/DSA/blob/main/Top-150/Arrays-And-Hashing/5-top-k-frequent-elements.md) |
| [Encode and Decode Strings](https://neetcode.io/problems/string-encode-and-decode) | Use a delimiter to separate the individual strings and include the length of each string before the delimiter to facilitate the decoding process. | [Solution](https://github.com/sharmahr/DSA/blob/main/Top-150/Arrays-And-Hashing/6-encode-decode-strings.md) |
| [Product of Array and Sef](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/description/) | Calculate the product of all the elements to the left of each index and the product of all the elements to the right of each index, and then multiply these two values to get the desired result. | [Solution](https://github.com/sharmahr/DSA/blob/main/Top-150/Arrays-And-Hashing/7-product-of-array-except-self.md) |
| [Valid Sudodu](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/description/) | Check the validity of each row, column, and 3x3 block separately. We can use a set to keep track of the numbers encountered in each row, column, and block. | [Solution](https://github.com/sharmahr/DSA/blob/main/Top-150/Arrays-And-Hashing/8-valid-sudoku.md) |
| [Longest Consecutive Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/description/) | Use a hash set to store all the numbers in the array and then iterate through the set to find the longest consecutive sequence | [Solution](https://github.com/sharmahr/DSA/blob/main/Top-150/Arrays-And-Hashing/9-longest-consecutive-sequence.md) |
