# Stack
| Problem | Notes | Solution |
|:-------------|:--------------:|-------------:|
| [Valid Parenthesis](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/description/) | Use a stack data structure to keep track of the opening parentheses encountered in the string. When we come across a closing parenthesis, we check if it matches the last opening parenthesis in the stack. If it doesn't match, or if the stack is empty (meaning there are more closing parentheses than opening ones), then the string is invalid. | [Solution](https://github.com/sharmahr/DSA/Top-150/Stack/1-valid-parenthesis.md) |
| [Min Stack](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-stack/) | Use a stack to store the elements and maintain a variable `min` to keep track of the minimum element at any given time. | [Solution](https://github.com/sharmahr/DSA/Top-150/Stack/2-min-stack.md) |

| [Generate Parenthesis](https://leetcode.com/problems/generate-parentheses/description/) | The key idea is to ensure that at any point in the recursion, the number of closing parentheses does not exceed the number of opening parentheses. This property ensures that the generated combinations are well-formed. | [Solution](https://github.com/sharmahr/DSA/Top-150/Stack/4-generate-parentheses.md) |
| [Daily Temperatures](https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/description/) | Row 3, Cell 2 | [Solution](https://github.com/sharmahr/DSA/Top-150/Stack/5-daily-temperatures.md) |
| [Car Fleet](https://leetcode.com/problems/car-fleet/description/) | The problem is to determine the number of car fleets that will arrive at the destination, given the positions and speeds of the cars. The key observation is that if a car catches up to another car or fleet, it will slow down to match their speed. This means that cars or fleets with the same time to reach the destination will form a single fleet. We can calculate the time it takes for each car to reach the destination and sort them in descending order. Then, we can iterate through the sorted times and group cars with the same time into a fleet. | [Solution](https://github.com/sharmahr/DSA/Top-150/Stack/6-car-fleet.md) |
| [Largest Rectangle in Histogram](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-rectangle-in-histogram/description/) | Use a stack to keep track of the indices of the bars that are part of the potential largest rectangle. We can iterate through the heights and update the area whenever we encounter a bar that ends a potential largest rectangle. | [Solution](https://github.com/sharmahr/DSA/Top-150/Stack/7-largest-rectangle-in-histogram.md) |


# Binary Search
| Problem | Notes | Solution |
|:-------------|:--------------:|-------------:|
| [Binary Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/description/) | The intuition is to repeatedly divide the search interval in half by comparing the middle element with the target value. If the middle element is equal to the target, we have found the solution. If the target is greater than the middle element, we search in the right half of the interval. Otherwise, we search in the left half of the interval. | [Solution](https://github.com/sharmahr/DSA/Top-150/Binary-Search/1-binary-search.md) |
| [Search a 2D Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix/description/) | The intuition is to treat the 2D matrix as a single sorted array and perform binary search on it. By flattening the matrix into a 1D array, we can leverage the existing binary search algorithm for sorted arrays or you can perform binary search without flattening the matrix just use the correct values of right and left. | [Solution](https://github.com/sharmahr/DSA/Top-150/Binary-Search/2-search-a-2d-matrix.md) |
| [Koko Eating Bananas](https://leetcode.com/problems/koko-eating-bananas/description/) | We can start with a minimum possible speed of 1 banana per hour and a maximum possible speed equal to the maximum pile size. Then, we can perform a binary search on the range of possible speeds and check if the current speed allows Koko to eat all the bananas within the given hour constraint. | [Solution](https://github.com/sharmahr/DSA/Top-150/Binary-Search/3-koko-eating-bananas.md) |

| [Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/) | Identify which half of the array is sorted and determine if the target element lies within that sorted half. By comparing the middle element with the target and the endpoints of the current search range, we can recursively narrow down the search space until the target is found or the search range is exhausted. | [Solution](https://github.com/sharmahr/DSA/Top-150/Binary-Search/5-search-in-rotated-sorted-array.md) |
| [Time Based Key Value Store](https://leetcode.com/problems/time-based-key-value-store/description/) | The intuition is to use a hash map to store the key-value pairs, where each key maps to a list of values along with their corresponding timestamps. To retrieve the value for a given key and timestamp, we can perform a binary search on the list of values to find the value with the highest timestamp less than or equal to the given timestamp. | [Solution](https://github.com/sharmahr/DSA/Top-150/Binary-Search/6-time-based-key-value-store.md) |
| [Median of Two Sorted Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/description/) | Perform a binary search on the smaller array to find the partition point that divides both arrays into left and right halves such that the elements in the left half are smaller than or equal to the elements in the right half. Once we find the correct partition, we can determine the median based on the maximum element in the left half and the minimum element in the right half. | [Solution](https://github.com/sharmahr/DSA/Top-150/Binary-Search/7-median-of-two-sorted-arrays.md) |

| [Merge Two Sorted List](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/description/) | Compare the values of the nodes in the two input lists and add the smaller value node to the new list, while moving the pointer in the corresponding input list forward. | [Solution](https://github.com/sharmahr/DSA/Top-150/Linked-List/2-merge-two-sorted-list.md) |
| [Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/description/) | The idea is to use two pointers, one moving twice as fast as the other. If there is a cycle, the two pointers will eventually meet. If there is no cycle, the faster pointer will reach the end of the list first. | [Solution](https://github.com/sharmahr/DSA/Top-150/Linked-List/3-linked-list-cycle.md) |
| [Reorder List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/) | Split the list into two halves, reverse the second half, and then merge the two halves by interleaving the nodes. | [Solution](https://github.com/sharmahr/DSA/Top-150/Linked-List/4-reorder-list.md) |
| [Remove Nth Node from the End](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/description/) | The intuition is to use two pointers, `first` and `second`, where `second` is initially ahead of `first` by `n` nodes. Then, move both pointers at the same pace until `second` reaches the end of the list. At this point, `first` will be pointing to the (n+1)th node from the end, and we can remove the next node (the nth node from the end). | [Solution](https://github.com/sharmahr/DSA/Top-150/Linked-List/5-remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list.md) |
| [Copy List with Random Pointer](https://leetcode.com/problems/copy-list-with-random-pointer/) | The intuition is to use a dictionary (HashMap) to map the original nodes to their corresponding copied nodes. We can then iterate through the original list, create copies of the nodes, and update the `next` and `random` pointers of the copied nodes based on the original nodes and the dictionary. | [Solution](https://github.com/sharmahr/DSA/Top-150/Linked-List/6-copy-list-with-random-pointer.md) |
| [Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/description/) | The intuition is to perform digit-wise addition, similar to how we add numbers on paper, and propagate the carry to the next digit. | [Solution](https://github.com/sharmahr/DSA/Top-150/Linked-List/7-add-two-numbers.md) |
| [Find the duplicate number](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/description/) | The intuition is to use the concept of linked lists to treat the array as a linked list with nodes pointing to the indices represented by their values. | [Solution](https://github.com/sharmahr/DSA/Top-150/Linked-List/8-find-the-duplicate-number.md) |
| [LRU Cache](https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/) | The intuition is to use a combination of a hash map (or dictionary) and a doubly-linked list to efficiently track the key-value pairs and their access order. | [Solution](https://github.com/sharmahr/DSA/Top-150/Linked-List/9-lru-cache.md) |
| [Merge K sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/description/) | We can use a min-heap to efficiently find the node with the smallest value among all the linked lists and add it to the merged list. This way, we can merge all the linked lists in a single pass. | [Solution](https://github.com/sharmahr/DSA/Top-150/Linked-List/10-merge-k-sorted-list.md) |
| [Reverse Nodes in K groups](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/description/) | The intuition is to use a recursive approach to reverse the first `k` nodes of the linked list, and then move to the next group of `k` nodes and repeat the process. We can keep track of the next group's starting node by maintaining a reference to the node right after the current group. | [Solution](https://github.com/sharmahr/DSA/Top-150/Linked-List/11-reverse-nodes-in-k-group.md) |

| [Maximum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/) | The maximum depth of a tree is the maximum depth of its left subtree or its right subtree, plus one (to account for the root node). We can recursively traverse the tree, calculate the maximum depth of the left and right subtrees, and return the maximum of the two depths plus one. | [Solution](https://github.com/sharmahr/DSA/Top-150/Tree/02-maximum-depth-of-binary-tree.md) |
| [Diameter of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/description/) | To find the diameter of a binary tree, consider three cases: the diameter passing through the root (sum of left and right subtree heights), or the diameter being entirely within the left or right subtree.

| [Subtree of another Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/subtree-of-another-tree/description/) | We can recursively compare each node of the main tree with the root of the subtree. If we find a node in the main tree that is the same as the root of the subtree, we can then compare the entire subtree starting from that node.

| [Binary Tree Right Side View](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-right-side-view/description/) | To find the right side view of a binary tree, we can perform a level order traversal (breadth-first search) and keep track of the rightmost node at each level. The rightmost node at each level will be the one visible from the right side. We can use a queue to perform the level order traversal and add the last node at each level to the result list. | [Solution](https://github.com/sharmahr/DSA/Top-150/Tree/09-binary-tree-right-side-view.md) |
| [Count Of Good Nodes in Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-good-nodes-in-binary-tree/description/) | To count the number of good nodes in a binary tree, we can perform a depth-first search (DFS) traversal and keep track of the maximum value encountered so far along each path. If the current node's value is greater than or equal to the maximum value seen so far, it is considered a good node. We can recursively traverse the tree and update the maximum value at each step. | [Solution](https://github.com/sharmahr/DSA/Top-150/Tree/10-count-good-nodes-in-binary-tree.md) |
| [Validate Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/description/) | Keep track of the valid range for each node based on its ancestors.
