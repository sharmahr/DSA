# Heap
| Problem | Notes | Solution |
|:-------------|:--------------:|-------------:|
| [Kth Largest Element in a stream](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-a-stream/) | The min-heap will store the k largest elements encountered so far. Whenever a new element is added, if it is larger than the smallest element in the min-heap (i.e., the root), we remove the root and insert the new element into the min-heap. This way, the root of the min-heap will always be the kth largest element. | [Solution](https://github.com/sharmahr/DSA/blob/main/Top-150/Heap/1-kth-largest-element-in-a-stream.md) |
| [Last Stone Weight](https://leetcode.com/problems/last-stone-weight/description/) | We can add all the stones to the max-heap and then repeatedly remove the two heaviest stones, smash them together, and add the resulting stone (if any) back to the heap until there is at most one stone left. The weight of the remaining stone (if any) will be the result. | [Solution](https://github.com/sharmahr/DSA/blob/main/Top-150/Heap/2-last-stone-weight.md) |
| [K Closest Points to Origin](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/description/) | To find the k closest points to the origin, we can calculate the distance of each point from the origin and use a max-heap to store the k closest points. The max-heap will store the points based on their distances from the origin in descending order. If a point has a smaller distance than the top element of the max-heap, we remove the top element and add the new point to the heap. This way, the max-heap will always maintain the k closest points. | [Solution](https://github.com/sharmahr/DSA/blob/main/Top-150/Heap/3-k-closest-points-to-origin.md) |
| [Kth Largest Element in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/description/) | We can maintain a min-heap of size k, where the heap stores the k largest elements encountered so far. Whenever we encounter a new element, if it is larger than the smallest element in the min-heap (i.e., the root), we remove the root and insert the new element into the min-heap. This way, the root of the min-heap will always be the kth largest element. | [Solution](https://github.com/sharmahr/DSA/blob/main/Top-150/Heap/4-kth-largest-element-in-a-array.md) |
| [Task Scheduler](https://leetcode.com/problems/task-scheduler/) | The idea is to schedule the tasks with the highest frequency first and distribute them evenly with cooling intervals in between. We can determine the minimum number of intervals required based on the maximum frequency of the tasks and the number of tasks with the maximum frequency. | [Solution](https://github.com/sharmahr/DSA/blob/main/Top-150/Heap/5-task-scheduler.md) |
| [Design Twitter](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-twitter/) | To design a simplified version of Twitter, we need to store the tweets posted by each user and keep track of the users that each user follows. We can use a map to store the tweets of each user, where the key is the user ID and the value is a list of tweets. We can also use another map to store the followings of each user, where the key is the user ID and the value is a set of user IDs that the user follows.To retrieve the news feed for a user, we need to get the most recent tweets from the user's own tweets and the tweets of the users they follow. We can use a priority queue to efficiently retrieve the top 10 most recent tweets. | [Solution](https://github.com/sharmahr/DSA/blob/main/Top-150/Heap/6-design-twitter.md) |
| [Find Median from Data Stream](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-median-from-data-stream/description/) | By maintaining a max-heap for the lower half of the numbers and a min-heap for the upper half of the numbers, we can efficiently access the middle element(s) to calculate the median. The key intuition is to balance the heaps so that the size difference between them is at most 1, and the top element of the max-heap is smaller than or equal to the top element of the min-heap. | [Solution](https://github.com/sharmahr/DSA/blob/main/Top-150/Heap/7-find-median-from-data-stream.md) |
