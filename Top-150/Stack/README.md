# Stack
| Problem | Notes | Solution |
|:-------------|:--------------:|-------------:|
| [Valid Parenthesis](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/description/) | Use a stack data structure to keep track of the opening parentheses encountered in the string. When we come across a closing parenthesis, we check if it matches the last opening parenthesis in the stack. If it doesn't match, or if the stack is empty (meaning there are more closing parentheses than opening ones), then the string is invalid. | [Solution](https://github.com/sharmahr/DSA/blob/main/Top-150/Stack/1-valid-parenthesis.md) |
| [Min Stack](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-stack/) | Use a stack to store the elements and maintain a variable `min` to keep track of the minimum element at any given time. | [Solution](https://github.com/sharmahr/DSA/blob/main/Top-150/Stack/2-min-stack.md) |
| [Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation](https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-reverse-polish-notation/description/) | Use a stack to evaluate the expression by pushing operands onto the stack and performing operations when an operator is encountered, using the operands from the top of the stack. | [Solution](https://github.com/sharmahr/DSA/blob/main/Top-150/Stack/3-evaluate-reverse-polish-notation.md) |
| [Generate Parenthesis](https://leetcode.com/problems/generate-parentheses/description/) | The key idea is to ensure that at any point in the recursion, the number of closing parentheses does not exceed the number of opening parentheses. This property ensures that the generated combinations are well-formed. | [Solution](https://github.com/sharmahr/DSA/blob/main/Top-150/Stack/4-generate-parentheses.md) |
| [Daily Temperatures](https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/description/) | Use a stack to keep track of the indices of the temperatures that are waiting for a warmer temperature. We can iterate through the temperatures in reverse order and update the answer for the indices in the stack whenever we encounter a warmer temperature. | [Solution](https://github.com/sharmahr/DSA/blob/main/Top-150/Stack/5-daily-temperatures.md) |
| [Car Fleet](https://leetcode.com/problems/car-fleet/description/) | The problem is to determine the number of car fleets that will arrive at the destination, given the positions and speeds of the cars. The key observation is that if a car catches up to another car or fleet, it will slow down to match their speed. This means that cars or fleets with the same time to reach the destination will form a single fleet. We can calculate the time it takes for each car to reach the destination and sort them in descending order. Then, we can iterate through the sorted times and group cars with the same time into a fleet. | [Solution](https://github.com/sharmahr/DSA/blob/main/Top-150/Stack/6-car-fleet.md) |
| [Largest Rectangle in Histogram](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-rectangle-in-histogram/description/) | Use a stack to keep track of the indices of the bars that are part of the potential largest rectangle. We can iterate through the heights and update the area whenever we encounter a bar that ends a potential largest rectangle. | [Solution](https://github.com/sharmahr/DSA/blob/main/Top-150/Stack/7-largest-rectangle-in-histogram.md) |
