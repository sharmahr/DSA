# Intuition
The problem is to reorder a singly linked list by modifying the list such that the nodes from the second half of the list are interleaved with the nodes from the first half of the list. The intuition is to split the list into two halves, reverse the second half, and then merge the two halves by interleaving the nodes.

# Approach
1. Find the middle of the linked list using the "slow" and "fast" pointer technique.
2. Reverse the second half of the linked list.
3. Interleave the nodes of the first and second halves by alternating between the two lists.

Steps in detail:
1. Use two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, to find the middle of the linked list. Move `slow` one step and `fast` two steps at a time. When `fast` reaches the end, `slow` will be at the middle.
2. Reverse the second half of the linked list by iterating through it and updating the next pointers.
3. Set `slow.next` to `null` to separate the two halves.
4. Merge the two halves by alternating between the nodes of the first and second halves. Use two pointers, `first` and `second`, to keep track of the current nodes in each half.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n)
* Space complexity: O(1)
The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list, as we need to traverse the list once to find the middle, once to reverse the second half, and once to merge the two halves. The space complexity is O(1) since we are using a constant amount of extra space (a few pointers).

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public void reorderList(ListNode head) {
        // this means there is only one element in the list
        if(head == null || head.next == null) return;

        ListNode slow = head, fast = head;
        while(fast.next != null && fast.next.next != null){
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }
        // slow pointer will point to the end of the first list
        // fast pointer will point to the first of the list
        ListNode prev = null, current = slow.next;
        while(current != null){
            ListNode temp = current.next;
            current.next = prev;
            prev = current;
            current = temp;
        }
        // end the link 
        slow.next = null;
        // now merge the prev and head
        // head value is pass by reference
        ListNode first = head, second = prev;
        while(first != null && second != null){
            ListNode firstNext = first.next;
            ListNode secondNext = second.next;
            first.next = second;
            second.next = firstNext;
            first = firstNext;
            second = secondNext;
        }
    }
}
```
