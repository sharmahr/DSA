[Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-sorted-array-to-binary-search-tree)

# Intuition
The problem asks to convert a sorted array into a height-balanced Binary Search Tree (BST). The key insight is that the middle element of the sorted array should be the root of the BST to maintain balance. We can then recursively apply this idea to the left and right subarrays to construct the left and right subtrees.

# Approach
1. Use a recursive method to construct the BST.
2. For each recursive call:
   - Find the middle element of the current subarray. This becomes the root of the current subtree.
   - Create a new TreeNode with this middle element.
   - Recursively construct the left subtree using the left half of the subarray.
   - Recursively construct the right subtree using the right half of the subarray.
3. The base case is when the start index exceeds the end index, in which case we return null.
4. Use two pointers (left and right) to keep track of the current subarray boundaries.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n)
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
Where n is the number of elements in the array. We visit each element exactly once to construct the BST.

- Space complexity: O(log n)
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
The space complexity is determined by the height of the recursion stack, which is O(log n) for a balanced tree. Note that the space used to store the output (the BST itself) is not counted as part of the space complexity.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode sortedArrayToBST(int[] nums) {
        if(nums == null || nums.length == 0) return null;
        return constructBST(nums, 0, nums.length - 1);
    }

    public TreeNode constructBST(int[] nums, int left, int right){
        if(left > right) return null;
        
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        TreeNode root = new TreeNode(nums[mid]);
        root.left = constructBST(nums, left, mid - 1);
        root.right = constructBST(nums, mid + 1, right);

        return root;
    }
}
