[Minimum Genetic Mutation](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-genetic-mutation)

# Intuition
To transform the start gene to the end gene with the minimum number of mutations, we can think of each gene as a node and each valid mutation as an edge in an unweighted graph. The problem can be solved using Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path from the start gene to the end gene, as BFS is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

# Approach
1. **Convert the Gene Bank to a Set**: This allows for O(1) lookups to check if a mutation is valid.
2. **Edge Case Check**: If the end gene is not in the gene bank, return -1 as it is impossible to reach it.
3. **Initialize BFS**: Use a queue to perform BFS. Start from the start gene.
4. **Define Possible Mutations**: The possible mutations are changing each character of the gene to one of 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T'.
5. **Perform BFS**:
   - For each gene in the queue, generate all possible single-character mutations.
   - If a mutation is valid (exists in the gene bank), add it to the queue and mark it as visited by removing it from the gene bank.
   - If the end gene is reached, return the number of mutations.
6. **Return Result**: If the end gene is not reached, return -1.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: 
  - $$O(N \times M \times 4)$$, where $$N$$ is the number of genes in the bank and $$M$$ is the length of each gene. We generate up to 4 mutations per character for each gene.
- Space complexity: 
  - $$O(N \times M)$$ for storing the gene bank and the queue used in BFS.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int minMutation(String startGene, String endGene, String[] bank) {
        // Step 1: Convert the bank array to a set for O(1) lookup
        Set<String> geneBank = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(bank));
        
        // If endGene is not in the bank, return -1
        if (!geneBank.contains(endGene)) {
            return -1;
        }
        
        // Step 2: Initialize BFS
        Queue<String> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.offer(startGene);
        int mutations = 0;
        
        // Step 3: Define possible gene characters
        char[] genes = new char[] {'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'};
        
        // Step 4: Start BFS
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int size = queue.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                String currentGene = queue.poll();
                if (currentGene.equals(endGene)) {
                    return mutations;
                }
                
                // Step 5: Generate all possible mutations
                char[] currentArray = currentGene.toCharArray();
                for (int j = 0; j < currentArray.length; j++) {
                    char oldChar = currentArray[j];
                    for (char gene : genes) {
                        if (gene == oldChar) {
                            continue;
                        }
                        currentArray[j] = gene;
                        String mutatedGene = new String(currentArray);
                        if (geneBank.contains(mutatedGene)) {
                            queue.offer(mutatedGene);
                            geneBank.remove(mutatedGene);  // Remove to avoid revisiting
                        }
                    }
                    currentArray[j] = oldChar;  // Restore original character
                }
            }
            mutations++;
        }
        
        return -1;  // If no valid path found
    }
}
