[Snakes and Ladder](https://leetcode.com/problems/snakes-and-ladders)

# Intuition
The problem of finding the shortest path to reach the last cell in a snakes and ladders board can be modeled as a shortest path problem on an unweighted graph. Each cell on the board can be seen as a node, and a dice roll can be seen as an edge to another node. By using a Breadth-First Search (BFS), we can explore all possible paths in the shortest number of moves.

# Approach
1. **Model the Board as a Graph**: Each cell on the board represents a node, and moving to another cell (through dice rolls) represents edges.
2. **BFS Initialization**: Start from cell 1 and use a queue to perform BFS. Track visited cells to avoid reprocessing.
3. **Process Each Cell**: For each cell, simulate dice rolls to find the next cells. If a snake or ladder exists, jump to the destination cell.
4. **Handle Coordinates**: Convert between the linear index and the 2D coordinates on the board to handle snakes and ladders.
5. **Check for Target**: If the target cell (n*n) is reached, return the number of moves. If the queue is exhausted and the target is not reached, return -1.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: 
$$O(n^2)$$ 
- Each cell can be visited once, and processing each cell involves checking up to 6 possible moves.
- Space complexity: 
$$O(n^2)$$ 
- Space is required for the queue and the visited array.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int snakesAndLadders(int[][] board) {
        int n = board.length;
        int target = n * n;
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[target + 1];
        
        queue.offer(1); // Start from the first cell
        visited[1] = true;
        int moves = 0;

        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int size = queue.size(); // Process all nodes at the current level
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                int current = queue.poll();
                if (current == target) {
                    return moves; // Reached the target cell
                }

                for (int next = current + 1; next <= Math.min(current + 6, target); next++) {
                    int[] coordinates = getCoordinates(next, n);
                    int row = coordinates[0];
                    int col = coordinates[1];
                    int destination = board[row][col] != -1 ? board[row][col] : next;
                    if (!visited[destination]) {
                        queue.offer(destination);
                        visited[destination] = true;
                    }
                }
            }
            moves++;
        }
        return -1; // Target cell not reachable
    }

    private int[] getCoordinates(int square, int n) {
        int row = (square - 1) / n;
        int col = (square - 1) % n;
        if (row % 2 != 0) {
            col = n - col - 1; // Reverse column direction for odd rows
        }
        return new int[]{n - row - 1, col}; // Convert to 2D coordinates
    }
}
