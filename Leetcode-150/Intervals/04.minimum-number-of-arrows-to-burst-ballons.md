[Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-arrows-to-burst-balloons/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

# Intuition
The problem involves finding the minimum number of arrows needed to burst all the balloons, where each balloon is represented by an interval. The main idea is to minimize the number of arrows by exploiting overlaps between intervals. If intervals overlap, they can be burst by a single arrow.

# Approach
1. **Sort the Intervals**: Sort the array of intervals by their end points. This allows us to efficiently find the minimum number of arrows needed by always aiming at the end of the current interval.
2. **Initialize Variables**: Start with one arrow aimed at the end of the first interval.
3. **Iterate Through the Intervals**:
   - If the start of the current interval is greater than the end of the last interval we aimed at, it means this interval cannot be burst by the current arrow. Thus, we need a new arrow aimed at the end of the current interval.
   - If the start of the current interval is less than or equal to the end of the last interval we aimed at, it means this interval can be burst by the current arrow.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n \log n)$$, where $$n$$ is the number of intervals. This complexity arises from the sorting step.
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$, not including the space required for the input data. We only use a constant amount of extra space for the variables.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int findMinArrowShots(int[][] points) {
        if (points == null || points.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        // Sort the balloons by their end points
        Arrays.sort(points, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[1], b[1]));
        
        int arrows = 1;
        int end = points[0][1];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < points.length; i++) {
            if (points[i][0] > end) {
                // Need a new arrow
                arrows++;
                end = points[i][1];
            }
            // Otherwise, current arrow can burst this balloon too
        }
        
        return arrows;
    }
}
