[Summary Ranges](https://leetcode.com/problems/summary-ranges/submissions/1318385400/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

# Intuition
The problem is to summarize a sorted array into ranges. My first thought is to iterate through the array and group consecutive numbers together. If a group of consecutive numbers is found, it should be represented as a range. If a number is not part of any group, it should be represented as a single number.

# Approach
1. **Initialize Variables**: Create a list to store the result. Use two variables, `start` and `prev`, to keep track of the beginning of the current range and the previous number, respectively.
2. **Iterate Through the Array**: 
   - Start from the second element and iterate through the array.
   - If the current number is not consecutive (i.e., `nums[i] != prev + 1`), add the current range to the result. If `start` equals `prev`, it means the range contains a single number; otherwise, it is a range.
   - Update the `start` to the current number if it is not the end of the array.
   - Update `prev` to the current number.
3. **Handle Edge Case**: If the array is empty, return the empty result list immediately.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$, where $$n$$ is the number of elements in the array. This is because we iterate through each element once.
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$, excluding the space required for the output list. The extra space used is constant.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public List<String> summaryRanges(int[] nums) {
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) {
            return result;
        }
        
        int start = nums[0];
        int prev = nums[0];
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= nums.length; i++) {
            if (i == nums.length || nums[i] != prev + 1) {
                if (start == prev) {
                    result.add(String.valueOf(start));
                } else {
                    result.add(start + "->" + prev);
                }
                
                if (i < nums.length) {
                    start = nums[i];
                }
            }
            
            if (i < nums.length) {
                prev = nums[i];
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
