[Longest Common Prefix](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-prefix/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)


# Intuition
To find the longest common prefix among a list of strings, we need to identify the longest initial sequence of characters that is shared among all the strings. This involves comparing characters at each position across all strings until a mismatch is found or the end of the shortest string is reached.

# Approach
1. Initialize an empty string to hold the result.
2. Determine the length of the shortest string in the array since the common prefix cannot be longer than this.
3. Iterate through each character position up to the length of the shortest string:
   - Compare the character at the current position in all strings.
   - If any string has a different character at the current position, stop the iteration.
   - If all characters match, add the character to the result string.
4. Return the resulting longest common prefix.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n \cdot m)$$, where $$n$$ is the number of strings and $$m$$ is the length of the shortest string. In the worst case, we may need to compare every character in each string.
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$, as we use a constant amount of extra space for variables and the result string.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public String longestCommonPrefix(String[] strs) {
        if (strs == null || strs.length == 0) {
            return "";
        }

        String result = "";
        int maxLength = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        
        for (String s : strs) {
            maxLength = Math.min(s.length(), maxLength);
        }
        
        boolean flag = false;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < maxLength; i++) {
            char c = strs[0].charAt(i);
            
            for (int j = 1; j < strs.length; j++) {
                if (strs[j].charAt(i) != c) {
                    flag = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            
            if (flag) {
                break;
            }
            
            result += Character.toString(c);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
