[Zigzag Conversion](https://leetcode.com/problems/zigzag-conversion/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

# Intuition
To convert a string into a zigzag pattern and then read it row by row, we need to understand how the characters are positioned in each row when written in a zigzag. The characters follow a specific pattern that can be replicated using careful indexing.

# Approach
1. If `numRows` is 1, return the input string as the zigzag pattern would be the same as the original string.
2. Initialize a `StringBuilder` to build the result.
3. Calculate the step size (`increment`) needed to move from one character to the next in a zigzag pattern for a given row.
4. Iterate through each row:
   - Append characters to the `StringBuilder` by jumping through the string in steps defined by `increment`.
   - For rows that are neither the first nor the last, append an additional character found by a secondary calculation, which considers the internal zigzag pattern.
5. Return the constructed string from the `StringBuilder`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$, where $$n$$ is the length of the input string. This is because each character in the string is processed once.
- Space complexity: $$O(n)$$, where $$n$$ is the length of the input string. This is due to the additional space used by the `StringBuilder`.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public String convert(String s, int numRows) {
        if(numRows == 1) return s;

        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        int increment = 2 * (numRows - 1);
        for(int r = 0; r < numRows; r++){
            for(int i = r; i < s.length(); i += increment){
                result.append(s.charAt(i));
                if(r > 0 && r < numRows - 1 && i + increment - 2 * r < s.length()){
                    result.append(s.charAt(i + increment - 2 * r));
                }
            }
        }

        return result.toString();
    }
}
```
