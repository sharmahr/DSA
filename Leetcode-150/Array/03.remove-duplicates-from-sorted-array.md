[Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

# Intuition
The problem appears to be about removing duplicates from a sorted array in-place. The key insight is to use two pointers: one to iterate through the array and another to keep track of where to place the next unique element. Remember that we're modifying the array in-place and returning the length of the modified array.

# Approach
1. Initialize a pointer `index` at 1, which will keep track of where to place the next unique element.
2. Iterate through the array starting from the second element (index 1).
3. Compare each element with the previous one.
4. If they are different, it means we've found a new unique element:
   - Place this element at the `index` position.
   - Increment `index`.
5. Continue until we've gone through the entire array.
6. The final value of `index` will be the length of the array with duplicates removed.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$
* Space complexity: $$O(1)$$

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        int index = 1;
        for(int i=1; i<nums.length; i++){
            if(nums[i] != nums[i-1]){
                nums[index] = nums[i];
                index += 1;
            }
        }
        return index;
    }
}
```
