[Merge Sorted Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

# Intuition
Merge the two sorted arrays in reverse order to avoid overwriting elements in `nums1`. This way, we can directly place the largest element from the end of either array into the end of `nums1`.

# Approach
We start by initializing pointers at the end of both arrays `nums1` and `nums2`. We then compare elements from the back, placing the larger one at the end of `nums1`. This process is repeated until we have exhausted one of the arrays. If there are remaining elements in `nums2`, we copy them into `nums1`. There is no need to handle the remaining elements in `nums1` since they are already in place.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: \(O(m + n)\)
- Space complexity: \(O(1)\)

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public void merge(int[] nums1, int m, int[] nums2, int n) {
        int index = m + n - 1;
        int i = m - 1, j = n - 1; // i is index of nums1 and j is index of nums2
        while(i >= 0 && j >= 0) {
            if(nums1[i] >= nums2[j]) {
                nums1[index] = nums1[i];
                i -= 1;
            } else {
                nums1[index] = nums2[j];
                j -= 1;
            }
            index -= 1;
        }

        // Merge the remaining array
        while(i >= 0) {
            nums1[index] = nums1[i];
            i -= 1;
            index -= 1; 
        }

        while(j >= 0) {
            nums1[index] = nums2[j];
            index -= 1;
            j -= 1;
        }
    }
}
```
