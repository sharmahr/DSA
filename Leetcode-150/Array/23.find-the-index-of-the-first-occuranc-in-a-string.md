[Find the index of the first occurance in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-index-of-the-first-occurrence-in-a-string/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

# Intuition
The problem involves finding the first occurrence of a substring (`needle`) within a string (`haystack`). A straightforward approach is to iterate through the `haystack` and compare substrings of the same length as `needle` to see if they match.

# Approach
1. Initialize pointers for `haystack` and `needle`.
2. Iterate through the `haystack`:
   - If the current character in `haystack` matches the first character of `needle`, check the following characters to see if they match the entire `needle`.
   - Use a flag to indicate if the full `needle` was found.
   - If a mismatch is found or the end of `haystack` is reached, reset the pointers appropriately.
3. If a match is found, return the starting index of the match.
4. If no match is found, return `-1`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n \cdot m)$$, where $$n$$ is the length of the `haystack` and $$m$$ is the length of the `needle`. In the worst case, for each character in the `haystack`, we might compare up to `m` characters of `needle`.
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$, since we are using a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int strStr(String haystack, String needle) {
        // Edge case: if needle is empty, return 0
        if (needle.length() == 0) return 0;
        
        int i = 0; // Pointer for haystack
        int j = 0; // Pointer for needle

        while (i < haystack.length()) {
            if (haystack.charAt(i) == needle.charAt(j)) {
                // Potential match found, check further characters
                int start = i;
                boolean flag = true;
                for (j = 1; j < needle.length(); j++) {
                    if (++i >= haystack.length() || haystack.charAt(i) != needle.charAt(j)) {
                        flag = false;
                        break;
                    }
                }
                if (flag) return start;
                // Reset pointers
                i = start;
                j = 0;
            }
            i++;
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
