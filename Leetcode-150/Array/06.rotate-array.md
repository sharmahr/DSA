# Intuition
This problem is about rotating an array to the right by k steps. The key insight is that rotating an array is equivalent to reversing specific portions of the array. Remember: reverse the whole array, then reverse the first k elements, and finally reverse the rest.

# Approach
1. First, handle the case where k is larger than the array length by using k %= nums.length.
2. Reverse the entire array.
3. Reverse the first k elements.
4. Reverse the remaining n-k elements.
5. Use a helper method 'reverse' to perform the reversals efficiently.

This approach effectively rotates the array without using extra space.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$
* Space complexity: $$O(1)$$

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public void rotate(int[] nums, int k) {
        k %= nums.length; // Handles cases where k is greater than the length of the array
        reverse(nums, 0, nums.length - 1); // Reverse the entire array
        reverse(nums, 0, k - 1); // Reverse the first k elements
        reverse(nums, k, nums.length - 1); // Reverse the rest of the array
    }

    void reverse(int[] arr, int start, int end) {
        while (start < end) {
            int temp = arr[start];
            arr[start] = arr[end];
            arr[end] = temp;
            start++;
            end--;
        }
    }
}
