# Intuition
The problem involves finding how much water can be trapped between bars of different heights after a rain. Initially, we can think about the fact that water trapped above a bar depends on the height of the tallest bars to its left and right. By maintaining two pointers from both ends of the array and keeping track of the maximum heights seen so far, we can efficiently calculate the trapped water.

# Approach
1. Initialize two pointers: `left` starting at the beginning of the array and `right` starting at the end of the array.
2. Use two variables, `leftMax` and `rightMax`, to keep track of the maximum height encountered so far from the left and right sides, respectively.
3. Iterate while `left` is less than `right`:
   - If the height at the left pointer is less than the height at the right pointer, then:
     - If the height at the left pointer is greater than or equal to `leftMax`, update `leftMax`.
     - Otherwise, calculate the trapped water at the left pointer and add it to the total.
     - Move the left pointer to the right.
   - If the height at the right pointer is less than or equal to the height at the left pointer, then:
     - If the height at the right pointer is greater than or equal to `rightMax`, update `rightMax`.
     - Otherwise, calculate the trapped water at the right pointer and add it to the total.
     - Move the right pointer to the left.
4. Return the total amount of trapped water.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$, where $$n$$ is the length of the height array. This is because we traverse the array only once.
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$, as we only use a few extra variables.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int trap(int[] height) {
        if (height == null || height.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        int left = 0, right = height.length - 1;
        int leftMax = 0, rightMax = 0;
        int waterTrapped = 0;

        while (left < right) {
            if (height[left] < height[right]) {
                if (height[left] >= leftMax) {
                    leftMax = height[left];
                } else {
                    waterTrapped += leftMax - height[left];
                }
                left++;
            } else {
                if (height[right] >= rightMax) {
                    rightMax = height[right];
                } else {
                    waterTrapped += rightMax - height[right];
                }
                right--;
            }
        }

        return waterTrapped;
    }
}
```
