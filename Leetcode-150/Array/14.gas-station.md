[Gas Station](https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)


# Intuition
This problem is about finding a starting gas station to complete a circular tour. The key insight is that if the total gas is greater than or equal to the total cost, a solution exists. Remember: if we can't reach a station from the current start, any station in between can't be the start either.

# Approach
1. First, check if a solution is possible:
   - Calculate the total gas and total cost.
   - If total cost > total gas, return -1 as it's impossible to complete the circuit.
2. If a solution is possible, find the starting station:
   - Iterate through the stations, keeping a running total of (gas[i] - cost[i]).
   - If at any point the total becomes negative, reset it to 0 and set the next station as the potential starting point.
3. Return the final starting point.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$
* Space complexity: $$O(1)$$

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int canCompleteCircuit(int[] gas, int[] cost) {
        int totalGas = 0, totalCost = 0, result = 0, total = 0;

        for(int i=0; i<gas.length; i++){
            totalGas += gas[i];
            totalCost += cost[i];
        }

        if(totalCost > totalGas) return -1; // answer is not possible

        for(int i=0; i<gas.length; i++){
            total += gas[i] - cost[i];
            if(total < 0){
                total = 0;
                result = i + 1;
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```
