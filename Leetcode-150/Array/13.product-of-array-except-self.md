# Intuition
This problem asks for the product of all elements except the current one for each position in the array. The key insight is to use prefix and suffix products. Remember: for each element, its result is the product of all elements before it multiplied by the product of all elements after it.

# Approach
1. Create two arrays: `pre` for prefix products and `suff` for suffix products.
2. Initialize `pre[0]` and `suff[n-1]` to 1 (neutral element for multiplication).
3. Calculate prefix products:
   - Iterate from left to right, computing the product of all elements to the left of each position.
4. Calculate suffix products:
   - Iterate from right to left, computing the product of all elements to the right of each position.
5. Compute the final result:
   - For each position, multiply its prefix product with its suffix product.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$
* Space complexity: $$O(n)$$

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] productExceptSelf(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int pre[] = new int[n];
        int suff[] = new int[n];
        pre[0] = 1;
        suff[n - 1] = 1;
        
        for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            pre[i] = pre[i - 1] * nums[i - 1];
        }
        for(int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            suff[i] = suff[i + 1] * nums[i + 1];
        }
        
        int ans[] = new int[n];
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            ans[i] = pre[i] * suff[i];
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
