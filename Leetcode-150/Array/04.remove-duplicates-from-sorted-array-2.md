[Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array 2](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array-ii/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)


# Intuition
This problem seems to be about removing duplicates from an array, but with a twist - we're allowing up to two occurrences of each number. The key insight is to use two pointers: one to iterate through the array and another to keep track of where to place the next valid element. Remember that we're comparing with the second-last placed element to allow up to two occurrences.

# Approach
1. Initialize a pointer `j` at 1, which will keep track of where to place the next valid element.
2. Iterate through the array starting from the second element (index 1).
3. For each element, check two conditions:
   - If `j` is 1 (meaning we're at the start), always place the element.
   - If the current element is different from the element two positions back in the modified part of the array (`nums[j-2]`).
4. If either condition is true, place the current element at position `j` and increment `j`.
5. Continue until we've gone through the entire array.
6. The final value of `j` will be the length of the modified array.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$
* Space complexity: $$O(1)$$

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        // inplace removal
        int j = 1;
        for(int i=1; i<nums.length; i++){
            if(j == 1 || nums[i] != nums[j-2]){
                nums[j] = nums[i];
                j += 1;
            }
        }
        return j;
    }
}
```
