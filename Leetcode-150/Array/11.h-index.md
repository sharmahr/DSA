[H Index](https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

# Intuition
The h-index problem requires finding the maximum value h where the researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times. The key insight is to sort the citations in descending order and then find the point where the citation count becomes less than the paper index. Remember: the h-index is the largest number where citations[h-1] >= h.

# Approach
1. Sort the citations array in ascending order.
2. Reverse the sorted array to get it in descending order.
3. Iterate through the reversed array:
   - If the current citation count is greater than or equal to the current index + 1, continue.
   - If it's less, return the current index as the h-index.
4. If we've gone through all citations without returning, the h-index is the length of the array.

This approach ensures we find the largest h-index that satisfies the condition.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n \log n)$$
* Space complexity: $$O(1)$$ or $$O(\log n)$$

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        int n = citations.length;
        Arrays.sort(citations);

        //reverse the array
        for(int i=0; i<n/2; i++){
            int temp = citations[i];
            citations[i] = citations[n-i-1];
            citations[n-i-1] = temp;
        }

        //calculate the answer
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
            if(citations[i] >= i + 1) continue;
            else return i;
        }
        return n;
    }
}
