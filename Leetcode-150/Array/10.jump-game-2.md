[Jump Game 2](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-ii/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150) 


# Intuition
This problem is about finding the minimum number of jumps to reach the end of an array. The key insight is to use a greedy approach, always jumping to the position that allows us to reach the farthest. Remember: we're not just looking at the immediate next jump, but the farthest we can reach from all positions within our current jump range.

# Approach
1. Initialize variables:
   - `jumps`: to keep track of the number of jumps
   - `currentEnd`: to mark the end of the current jump range
   - `farthest`: to track the farthest position we can reach
2. Iterate through the array (except the last element):
   - Update `farthest` with the maximum of current `farthest` and `i + nums[i]`
   - If we've reached the `currentEnd`:
     - Increment `jumps`
     - Update `currentEnd` to `farthest`
     - If `currentEnd` is at or beyond the last index, break the loop
3. Return the number of `jumps`

This approach ensures we always make the optimal jump to reach the end with minimum jumps.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$
* Space complexity: $$O(1)$$

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int jump(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length == 1) return 0;
        
        int jumps = 0;
        int currentEnd = 0;
        int farthest = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
            farthest = Math.max(farthest, i + nums[i]);
            
            if (i == currentEnd) {
                jumps++;
                currentEnd = farthest;
                
                if (currentEnd >= nums.length - 1) {
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return jumps;
    }
}
```
