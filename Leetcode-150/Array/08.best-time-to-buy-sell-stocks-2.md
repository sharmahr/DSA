[Best Time to buy and Sell Stock 2](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

# Intuition
This problem appears to be finding the maximum profit from buying and selling stocks, where multiple transactions are allowed. The key insight is to use a stack to keep track of future prices and identify profitable transactions. Remember: we're looking for any price increase between adjacent days, as we can buy and sell multiple times.

# Approach
1. Initialize a stack to store prices and an array `result` to store the next higher price for each day.
2. Iterate through the prices array from right to left:
   - While the stack is not empty and the top price is lower than the current price, pop from the stack.
   - If the stack becomes empty, set result[i] to -1 (no higher price in the future).
   - If the stack is not empty, set result[i] to the top of the stack (next higher price).
   - Push the current price onto the stack.
   - If result[i] is not -1, add the profit (result[i] - prices[i]) to maxProfit.
3. Return the total maxProfit.

This approach effectively calculates the sum of all price increases between adjacent days.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$
* Space complexity: $$O(n)$$

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<Integer>();
        int[] result = new int[prices.length];
        int maxProfit = 0;
        for(int i=prices.length-1; i>=0; i--) {
            if(!stack.isEmpty()) {
                while(!stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek()<prices[i]) {
                    stack.pop();
                }
                if(stack.isEmpty()) {
                    result[i] = -1;
                } else {
                    result[i] = stack.peek();
                }
            } else {
                result[i] = -1;
            }
            stack.push(prices[i]);
            if(result[i] != -1) {
                maxProfit += result[i] - prices[i];
            }
        }
        return maxProfit;
    }
}
