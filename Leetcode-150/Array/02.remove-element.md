[Remove Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

# Intuition
Remove all occurrences of a given value from an array in-place, minimizing the number of operations. Using a priority queue might be a straightforward approach but not optimal for this problem. Instead, a two-pointer technique would be more efficient.

# Approach
We can use a two-pointer approach where one pointer iterates through the array (`i`), and the other (`k`) keeps track of the position to place the next valid element. When we encounter an element not equal to the given value, we move it to the position pointed to by `k` and then increment `k`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: \(O(n)\)
- Space complexity: \(O(1)\)

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int removeElement(int[] nums, int val) {
        int k = 0; // Points to the next position to place the non-val element
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] != val) {
                nums[k] = nums[i];
                k++;
            }
        }
        return k;
    }
}
```
