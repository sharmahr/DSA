[Reverse Words in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

# Intuition
The problem involves reversing the order of words in a string while ensuring that the words themselves remain unchanged. Splitting the string by spaces and then reversing the order of the resulting words is a straightforward approach to solving this problem.

# Approach
1. Trim the input string to remove leading and trailing spaces.
2. Split the trimmed string by one or more spaces to get an array of words.
3. Use a `StringBuilder` to build the result string by iterating through the array of words from the last word to the first.
4. Append each word to the `StringBuilder` and add a space between words.
5. Convert the `StringBuilder` to a string and return it.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$, where $$n$$ is the length of the input string. This is because we process each character in the string once for trimming, splitting, and joining.
- Space complexity: $$O(n)$$, where $$n$$ is the length of the input string. This is because we store the split words in an array and the final result in a `StringBuilder`.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public String reverseWords(String s) {
        // Split the input string by one or more spaces
        String[] input = s.trim().split("\\s+");
        
        // Get the number of words
        int n = input.length;

        // If there are no words, return an empty string
        if (n == 0) {
            return "";
        }

        // Initialize the result with the last word
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder(input[n - 1]);

        // Loop through the words from the second last to the first
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            result.append(" ");
            result.append(input[i]);
        }

        return result.toString();
    }
}
