[Candy](https://leetcode.com/problems/candy/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

# Intuition
To distribute candies to children such that each child has at least one candy and children with higher ratings get more candies than their neighbors, we can use a two-pass approach. First, we ensure that children with higher ratings than the previous child get more candies, and then we ensure the same condition but in reverse order to handle cases where a child might need more candies than previously assigned.

# Approach
1. Initialize an array `candies` where each child gets at least one candy.
2. Traverse the `ratings` array from left to right, ensuring that if a child has a higher rating than the previous child, they get more candies.
3. Traverse the `ratings` array from right to left, ensuring that if a child has a higher rating than the next child, they get more candies, taking the maximum of current or updated value.
4. Sum up the values in the `candies` array to get the total number of candies required.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$
* Space complexity: $$O(n)$$

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int candy(int[] ratings) {
        int n = ratings.length;
        int[] candies = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(candies, 1);

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]) {
                candies[i] = candies[i - 1] + 1;
            }
        }

        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1]) {
                candies[i] = Math.max(candies[i], candies[i + 1] + 1);
            }
        }

        int totalCandies = 0;
        for (int candy : candies) {
            totalCandies += candy;
        }

        return totalCandies;
    }
}
