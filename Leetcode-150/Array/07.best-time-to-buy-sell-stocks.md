# Intuition
This problem is about finding the maximum profit from buying and selling a stock. The key insight is that we need to find the largest difference between two numbers in the array, where the smaller number comes before the larger number. Remember: we're always looking for the lowest buying price up to the current day and the highest profit we can make by selling on the current day.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
1. Initialize variables:
   - `min` to keep track of the lowest price seen so far, initially set to the first price.
   - `maxProfit` to store the maximum profit, initially set to 0.
2. Iterate through the prices starting from the second day:
   - If the current price is lower than `min`, update `min`.
   - Calculate the potential profit if we sell on the current day (current price - min).
   - Update `maxProfit` if this potential profit is higher than the current `maxProfit`.
3. After iterating through all prices, return `maxProfit`.

This approach effectively finds the maximum profit in a single pass through the array.

class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int length = prices.length;
        int min = prices[0];
        int maxProfit = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < length; i++) {
            if (prices[i] < min) {
                min = prices[i];
            }
            maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, prices[i] - min);
        }
        return maxProfit;
    }
}
