[Bitwise AND of Numbers Range](https://leetcode.com/problems/bitwise-and-of-numbers-range)

# Intuition
The problem requires finding the bitwise AND of all numbers between `left` and `right`, inclusive. Direct computation of the AND operation for all numbers in the range would be inefficient. Instead, we aim to find the common prefix or the highest bit position that both `left` and `right` share.

# Approach
1. **Bitwise Shift and Compare**: We perform right shifts on both `left` and `right` until they are equal. Each shift reveals a common prefix of the bits shared by `left` and `right`.
2. **Left Shift to Restore**: After identifying the common prefix, left shift `left` by the number of shifts performed to restore the actual result of the bitwise AND operation.
3. **Return Result**: The modified `left` after shifting provides the result of the bitwise AND of all numbers between `left` and `right`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
  - The while loop runs in $$O(\log \max(left, right))$$ time, where $$\max(left, right)$$ represents the larger number among `left` and `right`.
- Space complexity:
  - $$O(1)$$, as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int rangeBitwiseAnd(int left, int right) {
        int rightShift = 0;
        while (left != right) {
            left = left >> 1;
            right = right >> 1;
            rightShift++;
        }

        // Restore the result by left-shifting left by rightShift positions
        for (int i = 0; i < rightShift; i++) {
            left = left << 1;
        }

        return left;
    }
}
