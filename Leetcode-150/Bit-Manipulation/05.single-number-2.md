[Single Number 2](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-ii) 

# Intuition
The problem involves finding a number that appears once in an array where every other number appears three times. The key insight is to use bit manipulation, focusing on each bit position across all numbers. If a bit appears a number of times that's not divisible by 3, it must be part of the unique number.

# Approach
1. Iterate through each of the 32 bits of an integer (assuming 32-bit integers).
2. For each bit position:
   - Create a mask with only that bit set to 1.
   - Count how many numbers in the array have this bit set to 1.
   - If the count is not divisible by 3, this bit must be set in our unique number.
3. Build up the result by setting the appropriate bits based on these counts.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(32n) = O(n)
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
Where n is the number of elements in the array. We iterate through all n numbers 32 times (once for each bit).

- Space complexity: O(1)
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
We only use a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int result = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
            int temp = (1 << i);

            int countOnes = 0;
            for(int num : nums) {
                if((num & temp) != 0) countOnes++; // Check if the ith bit is set to 1
            }
            if(countOnes % 3 == 1) {
                // If the count of ones at the ith position is 1 modulo 3, set the ith bit in the result
                result = result | temp;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
