[Add Binary](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-binary)

# Intuition
The problem requires adding two binary strings and returning the result as a binary string. The addition should handle carries just like in regular binary addition, where each position can either be 0 or 1, with a carry potentially propagating to the next higher bit.

# Approach
1. **Iterative Addition**:
   - Initialize pointers `i` and `j` to the end of strings `a` and `b` respectively.
   - Use a `StringBuilder` to construct the result string in reverse order.
   - Traverse both strings from end to start, adding corresponding bits along with any carry from the previous addition.
   - Compute the sum of bits from `a`, `b`, and the carry, update the carry if necessary, and append the result (sum % 2) to the `StringBuilder`.
   
2. **Final Carry**:
   - After the loop, if there's any remaining carry left (i.e., `carry != 0`), append it to the result.

3. **Reverse and Return**:
   - Reverse the `StringBuilder` (since we constructed the result in reverse order) and convert it to a string.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: \( O(\max(m, n)) \), where \( m \) and \( n \) are the lengths of strings `a` and `b` respectively. This is because we iterate through both strings once.
- Space complexity: \( O(\max(m, n)) \) for storing the result in the `StringBuilder`.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public String addBinary(String a, String b) {
        StringBuilder res = new StringBuilder();
        int i = a.length() - 1;
        int j = b.length() - 1;
        int carry = 0;
        
        while (i >= 0 || j >= 0) {
            int sum = carry;
            if (i >= 0) sum += a.charAt(i--) - '0';
            if (j >= 0) sum += b.charAt(j--) - '0';
            carry = sum > 1 ? 1 : 0;
            res.append(sum % 2);
        }
        
        if (carry != 0) res.append(carry);
        
        return res.reverse().toString();
    }
}
```
