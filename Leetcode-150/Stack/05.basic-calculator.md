# Intuition
To solve this problem, my first thought is to parse the string and handle each character accordingly. The key operations involve managing digits, handling the signs of numbers, and managing parentheses which indicate precedence in calculations. Using a stack will help keep track of the results and signs when parentheses are encountered.

# Approach
1. Initialize a stack to manage intermediate results and signs.
2. Use variables to store the current result, the current number being processed, and the current sign.
3. Traverse through each character of the string:
   - If the character is a digit, build the number.
   - If the character is a '+' or '-', update the result with the current number and reset the number. Update the sign accordingly.
   - If the character is '(', push the current result and sign onto the stack, then reset them for a new sub-expression.
   - If the character is ')', finalize the current sub-expression, multiply by the sign before the parenthesis (from the stack), and add the result before the parenthesis (also from the stack).
4. After the loop, add any remaining number to the result.
5. Return the final result.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$, where n is the length of the string. Each character is processed once.
- Space complexity: $$O(n)$$, in the worst case, if there are a lot of nested parentheses, the stack could store up to n elements.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int calculate(String s) {
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        int result = 0;
        int number = 0;
        int sign = 1;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            char c = s.charAt(i);
            
            if (Character.isDigit(c)) {
                number = number * 10 + (c - '0');
            } else if (c == '+') {
                result += sign * number;
                number = 0;
                sign = 1;
            } else if (c == '-') {
                result += sign * number;
                number = 0;
                sign = -1;
            } else if (c == '(') {
                stack.push(result);
                stack.push(sign);
                result = 0;
                sign = 1;
            } else if (c == ')') {
                result += sign * number;
                number = 0;
                result *= stack.pop();    // Stack.pop() is the sign before the parenthesis
                result += stack.pop();    // Stack.pop() now is the result calculated before the parenthesis
            }
        }
        
        if (number != 0) {
            result += sign * number;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
