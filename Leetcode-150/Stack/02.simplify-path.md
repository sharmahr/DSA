[Simplify Path](https://leetcode.com/problems/simplify-path/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

# Intuition
To simplify a given file path, we need to handle various special cases such as current directory (`.`), parent directory (`..`), and empty components caused by consecutive slashes. The goal is to convert the path into its canonical form.

# Approach
1. **Split the Path**: Split the input path by the '/' character to get individual components.
2. **Use a Stack**: Use a stack to manage the directory components:
   - Push directory names onto the stack.
   - Pop the stack when encountering `..` to go up one level.
   - Ignore `.` and empty components as they don't affect the path.
3. **Construct the Result**: Join the components in the stack with '/' to build the simplified path.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$, where $$n$$ is the length of the input path. We process each character in the path exactly once.
- Space complexity: $$O(n)$$, where $$n$$ is the length of the input path. In the worst case, we store all components in the stack.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public String simplifyPath(String path) {
        // Split the path by '/'
        String[] components = path.split("/");
        
        // Use a stack to keep track of directories
        Deque<String> stack = new LinkedList<>();
        
        for (String component : components) {
            if (component.equals(".") || component.isEmpty()) {
                // Current directory or empty component, do nothing
                continue;
            } else if (component.equals("..")) {
                // Go up one level if possible
                if (!stack.isEmpty()) {
                    stack.removeLast();
                }
            } else {
                // Valid directory or file name
                stack.addLast(component);
            }
        }
        
        // Build the simplified path
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        for (String dir : stack) {
            result.append("/").append(dir);
        }
        
        // Handle the case of empty stack (root directory)
        return result.length() > 0 ? result.toString() : "/";
    }
}
