[N Queens 2](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-queens-ii)

# Intuition
The N-Queens problem is a classic backtracking problem. The key insight is that we can place queens row by row, ensuring that each new queen doesn't conflict with the previously placed queens. We need to keep track of occupied columns and diagonals to quickly check for conflicts.

# Approach
1. Use backtracking to try placing queens in different positions.
2. Maintain three boolean arrays to keep track of:
   - Occupied columns
   - Occupied major diagonals (top-left to bottom-right)
   - Occupied minor diagonals (top-right to bottom-left)
3. Start placing queens from the first row (row 0).
4. For each row:
   - Try placing a queen in each column.
   - If a placement is valid (doesn't conflict with previous queens), mark the column and diagonals as occupied.
   - Move to the next row and continue the process.
   - If we reach the last row, we've found a valid solution.
5. After trying a placement, backtrack by unmarking the column and diagonals.
6. Count the total number of valid solutions.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(N!)
In the worst case, we might need to explore all possible placements. However, the pruning of invalid paths significantly reduces this in practice.

- Space complexity: O(N)
We use three boolean arrays of size N or 2N, and the recursion stack can go up to depth N.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int totalNQueens(int n) {
        int[] count = new int[1];  // to store the number of solutions
        boolean[] cols = new boolean[n];  // columns where queens are placed
        boolean[] d1 = new boolean[2 * n];  // major diagonals
        boolean[] d2 = new boolean[2 * n];  // minor diagonals
        backtrack(0, n, cols, d1, d2, count);
        return count[0];
    }
    
    private void backtrack(int row, int n, boolean[] cols, boolean[] d1, boolean[] d2, int[] count) {
        if (row == n) {
            count[0]++;
            return;
        }
        
        for (int col = 0; col < n; col++) {
            int id1 = col - row + n;
            int id2 = col + row;
            if (cols[col] || d1[id1] || d2[id2]) continue;
            
            // place the queen
            cols[col] = true;
            d1[id1] = true;
            d2[id2] = true;
            
            backtrack(row + 1, n, cols, d1, d2, count);
            
            // remove the queen
            cols[col] = false;
            d1[id1] = false;
            d2[id2] = false;
        }
    }
}
