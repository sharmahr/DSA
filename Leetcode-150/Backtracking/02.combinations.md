# Intuition
To generate all possible combinations of `k` numbers out of the range from `1` to `n`, we can use a backtracking approach. Backtracking is effective for this type of problem because it allows us to explore all potential combinations by incrementally building candidates and abandoning those that fail to meet the criteria.

# Approach
1. **Initialize Result Storage**: Create a list to store all valid combinations.
2. **Backtracking Function**: Define a backtracking function that:
   - Adds the current number to the ongoing combination.
   - Recursively calls itself to add the next number.
   - Removes the last added number to backtrack and explore other combinations.
3. **Base Case**: When the size of the ongoing combination reaches `k`, add a copy of it to the result list.
4. **Loop Through Possible Numbers**: In the backtracking function, loop through possible numbers from the current start to `n`, adding each number to the current combination, then recursively backtracking with the next number.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: 
  - $$O(C(n, k))$$ where $$C(n, k)$$ is the binomial coefficient representing the number of ways to choose `k` elements from `n` elements. This is also known as "n choose k".
- Space complexity: 
  - $$O(k)$$ for the recursion stack and combination storage.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> combine(int n, int k) {
        List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();
        backtrack(result, new ArrayList<>(), 1, n, k);
        return result;
    }
    
    private void backtrack(List<List<Integer>> result, List<Integer> combination, int start, int n, int k) {
        // Base case: if the combination size is k, add it to the result
        if (combination.size() == k) {
            result.add(new ArrayList<>(combination));
            return;
        }
        
        // Explore from the current start to n
        for (int i = start; i <= n; i++) {
            combination.add(i);
            backtrack(result, combination, i + 1, n, k);
            combination.remove(combination.size() - 1);  // Backtrack
        }
    }
}
```
