[Factorial Trailing Zeros](https://leetcode.com/problems/factorial-trailing-zeroes)

# Intuition
The problem requires us to find the number of trailing zeros in the factorial of a given integer \( n \). Trailing zeros are produced by factors of 10, and factors of 10 are made up of pairs of 2 and 5. In factorials, there are always more factors of 2 than factors of 5, so the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of factors of 5 in \( n! \).

# Approach
1. **Count Factors of 5**: Iterate through numbers from 5 upwards, counting how many times each number divides \( n \), \( n/5 \), \( n/25 \), and so on until the division result is less than 1.
2. **Accumulate Counts**: Sum up all these counts to get the total number of trailing zeros in \( n! \).

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
  - \( O(\log_5 n) \). The loop runs until \( i \) becomes greater than \( n \), which happens approximately \( \log_5 n \) times.
- Space complexity:
  - \( O(1) \). The algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int trailingZeroes(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        
        // Count how many times 5, 25, 125, ... divide n
        for (int i = 5; n / i >= 1; i *= 5) {
            count += n / i;
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
