[Maximum Points on a Line](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-points-on-a-line)

# Intuition
The problem requires finding the maximum number of points that lie on the same straight line in a 2D plane given a set of points. This involves understanding how to calculate slopes between points and handling special cases like vertical lines.

# Approach
1. **Edge Cases**: If there are fewer than 3 points (`n <= 2`), the maximum number of points on the same line is simply `n`.
2. **Main Algorithm**:
   - Iterate through each point in the `points` array.
   - For each point, initialize a hashmap `mp` to store the count of points that share the same slope relative to the current point.
   - Also track the number of duplicate points (points that have the same coordinates).
   - Iterate through all other points to calculate the slope relative to the current point.
   - Special case handling for:
     - Vertical lines (where `dx = 0`): Use `Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY` as the key for the slope.
     - Horizontal lines (where `dy = 0`): Use `0.0` as the key for the slope.
   - Update the hashmap with the slope and increment the count for that slope.
   - After iterating through all points relative to the current point, update the result with the maximum of either the current result or the count of points sharing the same slope plus the number of duplicates.
3. **Result**: Return the maximum result found after iterating through all points.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: \( O(n^2) \), where \( n \) is the number of points. This is because for each point, we potentially compare it with every other point.
- Space complexity: \( O(n) \) for the hashmap `mp`, where `n` is the number of points. This is to store the slopes and their counts relative to each point.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxPoints(int[][] points) {
        int n = points.length;
        if (n <= 2) return n; // If there are less than 3 points, return n
        
        int result = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            HashMap<Double, Integer> mp = new HashMap<>();
            int duplicate = 1; // Count of points that are duplicates of points[i]

            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (points[i][0] == points[j][0] && points[i][1] == points[j][1]) {
                    duplicate++;
                    continue; // Skip duplicate points
                }

                int dx = points[j][0] - points[i][0];
                int dy = points[j][1] - points[i][1];

                // Calculate slope; use Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY for vertical lines
                double slope = dx == 0 ? Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY : dy == 0 ? 0 : (double) dy / dx;

                mp.put(slope, mp.getOrDefault(slope, 0) + 1);
            }

            result = Math.max(result, duplicate); // Update result with duplicates of points[i]

            for (int count : mp.values()) {
                result = Math.max(result, count + duplicate); // Update result with max points on the same line
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
}
