[Square Root](https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx)

# Intuition
The problem requires finding the integer square root of a given non-negative integer \( x \). This is essentially finding the largest integer \( \sqrt{x} \) such that \( \text{result}^2 \leq x \).

# Approach
1. **Binary Search**: Utilize binary search to efficiently find the square root. Initialize two pointers, `left` starting from 0 and `right` starting from \( x \).
2. **Binary Search Execution**: Calculate `mid` as the midpoint of `left` and `right`. Compute the square of `mid` and compare it with `x`:
   - If `mid^2 == x`, return `mid` as the result.
   - If `mid^2 > x`, adjust `right` to `mid - 1` to search in the lower half.
   - If `mid^2 < x`, adjust `left` to `mid + 1` to search in the upper half.
3. **Termination**: The loop terminates when `left` exceeds `right`. At this point, `right` will be the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to `x`, so return `right`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
  - \( O(\log x) \). Binary search reduces the search space logarithmically based on the input `x`.
- Space complexity:
  - \( O(1) \). The algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int mySqrt(int x) {
        long left = 0, right = x;
        
        while (left <= right) {
            long mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            long midSquared = mid * mid;
            
            if (midSquared == x) {
                return (int)mid;
            } else if (midSquared < x) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        
        // When left > right, return right as the largest integer whose square <= x
        return (int)right;
    }
}
