[Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum)

# Intuition
The problem asks to find if there's a root-to-leaf path that sums to a target value. This suggests a depth-first traversal of the tree, keeping track of the sum along each path. The key is to recognize that we're looking for a path that ends at a leaf node.

# Approach
1. Use a recursive depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the tree.
2. At each node, subtract the node's value from the target sum.
3. If we reach a leaf node (no left or right child) and the remaining sum is 0, we've found a valid path.
4. Recursively check the left and right subtrees with the updated sum.
5. Return true if either subtree returns true, false otherwise.
6. Handle the base case of an empty tree by returning false.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n)
We visit each node exactly once, where n is the number of nodes in the tree.

- Space complexity: O(h)
Where h is the height of the tree. This space is used by the recursion stack. In the worst case of a skewed tree, this could be O(n), but for a balanced tree, it would be O(log n).

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean hasPathSum(TreeNode root, int targetSum) {
        if(root == null) return false;
        if(root.val == targetSum && root.right == null && root.left == null) return true;
        targetSum -= root.val;
        return hasPathSum(root.left, targetSum) || hasPathSum(root.right, targetSum);
    }
}
```
