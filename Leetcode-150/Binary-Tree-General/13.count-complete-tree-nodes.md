[Count Complete Tree Nodes](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-complete-tree-nodes)

# Intuition
The problem asks to count the number of nodes in a binary tree. The most straightforward approach is to traverse the entire tree and count each node. A recursive depth-first search (DFS) can efficiently accomplish this task.

# Approach
1. Use a recursive function to traverse the tree.
2. For each node:
   - If the node is null, return 0 (base case).
   - Otherwise, return 1 (counting the current node) plus the sum of nodes in the left and right subtrees.
3. The recursion naturally covers all nodes in the tree.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n)
Where n is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node exactly once.

- Space complexity: O(h)
Where h is the height of the tree. This space is used by the recursion stack. In the worst case of a skewed tree, this could be O(n), but for a balanced tree, it would be O(log n).

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int countNodes(TreeNode root) {
        if(root == null) return 0;
        return 1 + countNodes(root.left) + countNodes(root.right);
    }
}
```
