[Symmetric Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree)

# Intuition
The problem is to determine if a binary tree is symmetric around its center. A symmetric tree is a mirror image of itself. The first thought is to compare the left and right subtrees of the root to check if they are mirror images of each other.

# Approach
1. **Base Case**: If the tree is empty (`root` is null), it is symmetric by definition.
2. **Recursive Comparison**: Create a helper function `isMirror` that takes two nodes and checks if:
   - Both nodes are null (they are mirrors).
   - One of them is null (they are not mirrors).
   - The values of the nodes are equal, and the left subtree of one is a mirror of the right subtree of the other, and vice versa.
3. **Initial Call**: Start the recursion by calling `isMirror` with the left and right children of the root.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$, where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited once.
- Space complexity: $$O(h)$$, where \(h\) is the height of the tree. This accounts for the space used by the recursive call stack.

# Code
```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }

class Solution {
    public boolean isSymmetric(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return true;
        return isMirror(root.left, root.right);
    }

    public boolean isMirror(TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
        if (left == null && right == null) return true;
        if (left == null || right == null) return false;
        return (left.val == right.val) && isMirror(left.left, right.right) && isMirror(left.right, right.left);
    }
}
