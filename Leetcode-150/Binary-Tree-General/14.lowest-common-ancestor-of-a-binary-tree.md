[Lowest Common Ancestor of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree)

# Intuition
The lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes in a binary tree is the deepest node that is an ancestor to both nodes. We can solve this problem using a bottom-up approach, where we traverse the tree and look for the nodes p and q. The key insight is that the LCA is the first node we encounter that has p and q in different subtrees (or is one of p or q itself).

# Approach
1. Use a recursive depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the tree.
2. Base case: If the current node is null or equal to either p or q, return the current node.
3. Recursively search for p and q in the left and right subtrees.
4. After the recursive calls:
   - If both left and right subtrees return a non-null value, the current node is the LCA.
   - If only one subtree returns a non-null value, that subtree contains the LCA.
   - If both subtrees return null, there is no LCA in this subtree.
5. Return the appropriate node based on the above conditions.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n)
Where n is the number of nodes in the tree. In the worst case, we might need to visit all nodes to find p and q.

- Space complexity: O(h)
Where h is the height of the tree. This space is used by the recursion stack. In the worst case of a skewed tree, this could be O(n), but for a balanced tree, it would be O(log n).

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        if(root == null || root == p || root == q) return root;

        TreeNode left = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
        TreeNode right = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);

        if(left != null && right != null) return root;
        if(left != null) return left;
        return right;
    }
}
```
