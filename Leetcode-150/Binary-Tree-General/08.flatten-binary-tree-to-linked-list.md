[Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-binary-tree-to-linked-list)

# Intuition
The problem requires flattening a binary tree into a "right-skewed" tree. A pre-order traversal (root, left, right) naturally gives the order we want in the flattened tree. The key is to maintain the original right subtree while attaching the flattened left subtree to the right of the root.

# Approach
1. Use a recursive approach to flatten the tree.
2. For each node:
   - Recursively flatten the left subtree.
   - Save the right subtree in a temporary variable.
   - Make the flattened left subtree the new right subtree.
   - Set the left subtree to null.
   - Traverse to the end of the new right subtree and attach the original right subtree.
   - Recursively flatten the right subtree.
3. The base case is when the node is null.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n)
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
We visit each node once, but for each node, we might need to traverse to the end of its right subtree. However, across the entire process, we traverse each edge at most twice, so the overall complexity remains O(n).

- Space complexity: O(h)
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
Where h is the height of the tree. This space is used by the recursion stack. In the worst case of a skewed tree, this could be O(n), but for a balanced tree, it would be O(log n).

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public void flatten(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return;

        flatten(root.left);
        // flatten
        TreeNode temp = root.right;
        root.right = root.left;
        root.left = null;
        if (root.right == null) {
            root.right = temp;
        } else {
            TreeNode current = root.right;
            while (current.right != null) {
                current = current.right;
            }
            current.right = temp;
        }
        flatten(root.right);
    }
}
