[Sum Root to Leaf Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-root-to-leaf-numbers)

# Intuition
The problem requires summing up all root-to-leaf numbers in a binary tree. Each path from root to leaf represents a number, where each node contributes a digit. A depth-first search (DFS) approach can be used to traverse all paths from root to leaf, building the numbers along the way.

# Approach
1. Use a recursive DFS to traverse the tree.
2. At each node, append its value to the current path string.
3. When a leaf node is reached, add the complete path string to a list of results.
4. After traversing the entire tree, convert each string in the result list to an integer and sum them up.
5. Handle the base case of an empty tree by returning 0.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n)
We visit each node once during the DFS. The final summation also takes O(n) time in the worst case where all nodes are leaf nodes.

- Space complexity: O(n)
In the worst case, we store all leaf-to-root paths in the result list. For a balanced tree, this would be O(n/2) which simplifies to O(n). The recursion stack also uses O(h) space, where h is the height of the tree, which in the worst case of a skewed tree could be O(n).

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int sumNumbers(TreeNode root) {
        if(root == null) return 0;
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        helper(root, result, "");
        int sum = 0;
        for(String s: result){
            sum += Integer.parseInt(s);
        }
        return sum;
    }

    public void helper(TreeNode root, List<String> list, String s){
        if(root.left == null && root.right == null){
            s += Integer.toString(root.val);
            list.add(s);
            return;
        }

        s += Integer.toString(root.val);
        if(root.left != null)
            helper(root.left, list, s);
        if(root.right != null)
            helper(root.right, list, s);
    }
}
