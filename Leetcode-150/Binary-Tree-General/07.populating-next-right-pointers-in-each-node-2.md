[Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II](https://leetcode.com/problems/populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node-ii) 


# Intuition
The problem requires connecting nodes at the same level in a binary tree. A level-order traversal (breadth-first search) seems natural for this, as it processes nodes level by level. Using a queue allows us to keep track of nodes at each level and connect them accordingly.

# Approach
1. Use a queue for level-order traversal of the tree.
2. Start by adding the root to the queue.
3. For each level:
   - Get the number of nodes at the current level.
   - Process all but the last node:
     * Connect each node to the next node in the queue.
     * Add its children (if any) to the queue.
   - Process the last node separately (it doesn't have a next node on this level).
4. Repeat until the queue is empty.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n)
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
We visit each node exactly once, where n is the number of nodes in the tree.

- Space complexity: O(w)
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
Where w is the maximum width of the tree. In the worst case of a complete binary tree, this could be up to n/2 for the last level, so O(n).

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public Node connect(Node root) {
        // Level order traversal
        if(root == null) return root;
        Queue<Node> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.offer(root);

        while(!queue.isEmpty()){
            int size = queue.size();
            for(int i=0;i<size-1;i++){
                Node front = queue.poll();
                //find the next
                if(!queue.isEmpty()){
                    front.next = queue.peek();
                }

                //push the left and right child
                if(front.left != null){
                    queue.offer(front.left);
                }
                if(front.right != null){
                    queue.offer(front.right);
                }
            }

            // process the last node
            Node front = queue.poll();
            //push the left and right child
            if(front.left != null){
                queue.offer(front.left);
            }
            if(front.right != null){
                queue.offer(front.right);
            }
        }
        return root;
    }
}
