[Is Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

# Intuition
The problem requires determining if string `s` is a subsequence of string `t`, meaning that `s` can be derived from `t` by deleting some characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

# Approach
1. Use two pointers, `sp` for `s` and `tp` for `t`, initialized to 0.
2. Traverse through both strings:
   - If characters `s.charAt(sp)` and `t.charAt(tp)` match, move the pointer `sp` to the next character in `s`.
   - Always move the pointer `tp` to the next character in `t`.
3. After traversing through `t`, if `sp` equals the length of `s`, then all characters of `s` have been found in `t` in the same order, and `s` is a subsequence of `t`.
4. Return `true` if `sp` equals the length of `s`, otherwise return `false`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$, where $$n$$ is the length of `t`. We traverse `t` once.
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$, as we are using constant extra space.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isSubsequence(String s, String t) {
        int sp = 0, tp = 0;
        while (sp < s.length() && tp < t.length()) {
            if (s.charAt(sp) == t.charAt(tp)) {
                sp++;
            }
            tp++;
        }
        return sp == s.length();
    }
}
```
