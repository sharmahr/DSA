[Two Sum when input array is sorted](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

# Intuition
The problem requires finding two numbers in a sorted array (`numbers`) that add up to a specific target value. This can be efficiently achieved using a two-pointer technique due to the sorted nature of the array.

# Approach
1. Initialize two pointers, `left` pointing to the beginning of the array (`0`) and `right` pointing to the end of the array (`numbers.length - 1`).
2. Iterate through the array:
   - Calculate the sum of the numbers at `left` and `right`.
   - If the sum is greater than the `target`, move the `right` pointer to the left to decrease the sum.
   - If the sum is less than the `target`, move the `left` pointer to the right to increase the sum.
   - If the sum equals the `target`, return the indices (`left + 1` and `right + 1`) since the problem requires 1-based indices.
3. If no such pair is found after iterating through the array, return `[0, 0]`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$, where $$n$$ is the number of elements in the `numbers` array. Each element is processed at most once.
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$, as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] numbers, int target) {
        int right = numbers.length - 1;
        int left = 0;
        
        while (left < right) {
            int sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
            
            if (sum > target) {
                right--;
            } else if (sum < target) {
                left++;
            } else {
                // Found the pair that sums to target
                return new int[]{left + 1, right + 1};
            }
        }
        
        // No valid pair found
        return new int[]{0, 0};
    }
}
```
