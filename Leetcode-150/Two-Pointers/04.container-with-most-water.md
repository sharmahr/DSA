# Intuition
The problem is to find the maximum area that can be formed between two vertical lines in a histogram represented by an array where the x-axis represents positions and the y-axis represents the heights of bars. The area is determined by the shorter line's height and the distance between the lines.

# Approach
1. Use two pointers, `left` starting from the beginning (`0`) and `right` from the end (`height.length - 1`) of the array.
2. Calculate the area between the lines at `left` and `right` using the formula: `min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left)`.
3. Update `maxArea` with the maximum of its current value and the calculated area.
4. Move the pointer that points to the shorter line inward (`left++` or `right--`) to potentially find a taller line and increase the area.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until `left` surpasses `right`.
6. Return `maxArea`, which holds the maximum area found during the traversal.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$, where $$n$$ is the number of elements in the `height` array. The two-pointer approach ensures that each pointer moves at most `n-1` steps, resulting in linear time complexity.
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$, as we use only a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int maxArea = 0;
        int left = 0;
        int right = height.length - 1;

        while (left < right) {
            int width = right - left;
            int currentArea = Math.min(height[left], height[right]) * width;
            maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, currentArea);

            // Move the pointer that points to the shorter line
            if (height[left] < height[right]) {
                left++;
            } else {
                right--;
            }
        }

        return maxArea;
    }
}
