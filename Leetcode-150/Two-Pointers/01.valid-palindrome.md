[Valid Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

# Intuition
To determine if a string is a palindrome, we need to consider only alphanumeric characters and ignore cases. This means we should be able to compare characters from the start and end of the string moving towards the center, skipping non-alphanumeric characters and ignoring their case.

# Approach
1. Use two pointers: one starting from the beginning (`start`) and the other from the end (`last`) of the string.
2. Iterate through the string:
   - Skip non-alphanumeric characters by moving the `start` pointer to the right and the `last` pointer to the left.
   - Compare the characters at `start` and `last` pointers.
   - If they are not equal, return `false`.
   - If they are equal, move both pointers towards the center.
3. If the entire string is traversed without mismatches, return `true`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$, where $$n$$ is the length of the string. Each character is processed at most once.
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$, as no extra space proportional to the input size is used.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(String s) {
        if (s.isEmpty()) {
            return true;
        }
        int start = 0;
        int last = s.length() - 1;
        while (start <= last) {
            char currFirst = s.charAt(start);
            char currLast = s.charAt(last);
            if (!Character.isLetterOrDigit(currFirst)) {
                start++;
            } else if (!Character.isLetterOrDigit(currLast)) {
                last--;
            } else {
                if (Character.toLowerCase(currFirst) != Character.toLowerCase(currLast)) {
                    return false;
                }
                start++;
                last--;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
