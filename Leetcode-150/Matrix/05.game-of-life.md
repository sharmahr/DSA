# Intuition
The key insight for this problem is to use in-place modification of the board while preserving the original state information. We can achieve this by using additional states to represent cells that will change in the next generation. This allows us to update the board in a single pass without using extra space for a copy of the board.

# Approach
Here's a breakdown of the key aspects:

1. We use two additional states: `die` (2) for cells that are currently alive but will die, and `live` (3) for cells that are currently dead but will become alive.

2. The algorithm performs two passes over the board:
   - First pass: Determine the next state for each cell based on its neighbors, marking cells that will change state.
   - Second pass: Update the board to its final state, changing marked cells to their new states.

3. The `countLiveNeighbors` method efficiently counts live neighbors, considering both currently live cells (1) and cells that were live but will die (2).

4. The solution handles edge cases, such as empty boards or boards with zero dimensions.


# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the board. We iterate through each cell once and perform constant-time operations for each cell.
* Space complexity: O(1), as we modify the board in-place without using any additional data structures that grow with the input size.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    private int die = 2;  // Cell will die in the next state
    private int live = 3; // Cell will live in the next state

    public void gameOfLife(int[][] board) {
        if (board == null || board.length == 0 || board[0].length == 0) {
            return;
        }

        int rows = board.length;
        int cols = board[0].length;

        // First pass: mark cells that will change state
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
                int liveNeighbors = countLiveNeighbors(board, i, j);

                if (board[i][j] == 1) {
                    if (liveNeighbors < 2 || liveNeighbors > 3) {
                        board[i][j] = die; // Currently live, but will die
                    }
                } else if (liveNeighbors == 3) {
                    board[i][j] = live; // Currently dead, but will live
                }
            }
        }

        // Second pass: update the board to its next state
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
                if (board[i][j] == die) {
                    board[i][j] = 0;
                } else if (board[i][j] == live) {
                    board[i][j] = 1;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    private int countLiveNeighbors(int[][] board, int row, int col) {
        int count = 0;
        int[] dx = {-1, -1, -1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1};
        int[] dy = {-1, 0, 1, -1, 1, -1, 0, 1};

        for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
            int newRow = row + dx[i];
            int newCol = col + dy[i];

            if (newRow >= 0 && newRow < board.length && newCol >= 0 && newCol < board[0].length) {
                if (board[newRow][newCol] == 1 || board[newRow][newCol] == die) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
}
