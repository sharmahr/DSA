[Average of Levels in Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/average-of-levels-in-binary-tree)

# Intuition
The problem requires calculating the average value of nodes at each level in a binary tree. This naturally suggests a level-order traversal (breadth-first search) approach, where we process the tree level by level and compute the average for each level.

# Approach
1. Use a queue to perform a level-order traversal of the tree.
2. At each level:
   - Get the number of nodes at the current level (queue size).
   - Sum up the values of all nodes at this level.
   - Add the children of these nodes to the queue for the next level.
   - Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the number of nodes.
   - Add this average to the result list.
3. Continue until the queue is empty (all levels processed).

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n)
Where n is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node exactly once.

- Space complexity: O(w)
Where w is the maximum width of the tree. In the worst case of a complete binary tree, this could be up to n/2 for the last level, so O(n).

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public List<Double> averageOfLevels(TreeNode root) {
        List<Double> result = new ArrayList<>();
        Queue<TreeNode> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.add(root);
        while(!queue.isEmpty()){
            long sum = 0;
            int size = queue.size();
            for(int i=0;i<size;i++){
                TreeNode head = queue.poll();
                sum += head.val;
                if(head.left != null){
                    queue.offer(head.left);
                }
                if(head.right != null){
                    queue.offer(head.right);
                }
            }
            result.add((double)sum/size);
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
