[Edit Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/description)

# Intuition
The problem involves finding the minimum number of operations required to convert `word1` into `word2` using three operations: insertion, deletion, or substitution of a character. The goal is to determine the minimum edit distance between two strings.

# Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**:
   - Use a 2D DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum edit distance between the first `i` characters of `word1` and the first `j` characters of `word2`.
   - Initialize the DP table:
     - `dp[i][0]` represents the cost to convert `word1.substring(0, i)` to an empty string, which requires `i` deletions.
     - `dp[0][j]` represents the cost to convert an empty string to `word2.substring(0, j)`, which requires `j` insertions.
   - Fill the DP table based on the characters of `word1` and `word2`:
     - If `word1.charAt(i-1) == word2.charAt(j-1)`, no operation is needed (`dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]`).
     - Otherwise, consider three possible operations:
       - **Substitution**: `dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`
       - **Insertion**: `dp[i][j-1] + 1`
       - **Deletion**: `dp[i-1][j] + 1`
     - Choose the minimum of these operations for `dp[i][j]`.

2. **Result**: The value at `dp[m][n]` (where `m` and `n` are lengths of `word1` and `word2` respectively) will give the minimum edit distance.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(m \times n) \), where `m` and `n` are lengths of `word1` and `word2` respectively. This is because we fill up an `m+1` by `n+1` DP table.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(m \times n) \) for the DP table. It could be optimized to \( O(\min(m, n)) \) by using two 1D arrays because each state only depends on the previous states.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int minDistance(String word1, String word2) {
        int m = word1.length();
        int n = word2.length();
        
        // Create a DP table
        int[][] dp = new int[m + 1][n + 1];
        
        // Initialize the DP table
        for (int i = 0; i <= m; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = i; // Minimum operations to convert word1.substring(0, i) to ""
        }
        for (int j = 0; j <= n; j++) {
            dp[0][j] = j; // Minimum operations to convert "" to word2.substring(0, j)
        }
        
        // Fill the DP table
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                if (word1.charAt(i - 1) == word2.charAt(j - 1)) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]; // Characters match, no additional operation needed
                } else {
                    // Minimum of substitution, insertion, or deletion
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i - 1][j - 1], Math.min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])) + 1;
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Return the minimum edit distance which is stored in dp[m][n]
        return dp[m][n];
    }
}
