[Best Time to Buy and Sell Stocks 3](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iii)

# Intuition
The problem involves maximizing profit from at most two transactions of buying and selling stocks. The key is to track the best times to buy and sell to achieve the maximum profit possible.

# Approach
1. **State Variables**:
   - `buy1`: The maximum profit after the first buy (initially set to a very large negative value to simulate buying at the lowest possible price).
   - `sell1`: The maximum profit after the first sell.
   - `buy2`: The maximum profit after the second buy (considering profits after the first transaction).
   - `sell2`: The maximum profit after the second sell (the final answer we want to compute).

2. **Iterate Through Prices**:
   - For each price in the `prices` array, update the state variables:
     - `buy1` should be the maximum of its current value or the negative of the current price (simulating buying the stock).
     - `sell1` should be the maximum of its current value or the profit from selling the stock bought at `buy1` plus the current price.
     - `buy2` should be the maximum of its current value or the profit from selling the stock at `sell1` minus the current price (simulating buying the stock again).
     - `sell2` should be the maximum of its current value or the profit from selling the stock bought at `buy2` plus the current price.

3. **Result**:
   - After iterating through all prices, `sell2` will hold the maximum profit achievable with at most two transactions.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the length of the `prices` array. We iterate through the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(1) \). We use only a constant amount of extra space for the state variables `buy1`, `sell1`, `buy2`, and `sell2`.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int buy1 = Integer.MIN_VALUE, buy2 = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int sell1 = 0, sell2 = 0;
        
        for (int price : prices) {
            buy1 = Math.max(buy1, -price);
            sell1 = Math.max(sell1, buy1 + price);
            buy2 = Math.max(buy2, sell1 - price);
            sell2 = Math.max(sell2, buy2 + price);
        }
        
        return sell2;
    }
}
