[Interleaving Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/interleaving-string/)

# Intuition
To determine if `s3` can be formed by interleaving `s1` and `s2`, we can employ a recursive approach with memoization. This problem can be visualized as a tree of decisions where at each step, we decide whether to take the next character from `s1` or `s2` to match the current character of `s3`.

# Approach
1. **Recursive Approach**: Use a recursive function `isInterleaveHelper` that checks if we can form `s3` starting from indices `i`, `j`, and `k` of `s1`, `s2`, and `s3` respectively.
   - If `s1[i]` matches `s3[k]`, recursively check for the next characters in `s1` and `s3`.
   - If `s2[j]` matches `s3[k]`, recursively check for the next characters in `s2` and `s3`.
   - Memoize the results to avoid redundant calculations.

2. **Base Cases**:
   - If `k` (the index in `s3`) reaches its length, it means we have successfully interleaved `s1` and `s2` to form `s3`.

3. **Memoization**:
   - Use a 2D `Boolean` array `memo` to store results of subproblems (`memo[i][j]` indicates if `s1[i...]` and `s2[j...]` can form `s3[k...]`).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the total length of `s1` and `s2` does not match `s3`, return `false` immediately.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(m \times n) \), where \( m \) is the length of `s1` and \( n \) is the length of `s2`. This is because each subproblem is solved once, and memoization ensures that each state is computed only once.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(m \times n) \) for the memoization table, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of `s1` and `s2` respectively. Additional space complexity comes from the recursion stack, which is \( O(m + n) \) in the worst case.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isInterleave(String s1, String s2, String s3) {
        int len1 = s1.length();
        int len2 = s2.length();
        int len3 = s3.length();

        // If the total length of s1 and s2 is not equal to s3, return false immediately
        if (len1 + len2 != len3) {
            return false;
        }

        // Memoization table
        Boolean[][] memo = new Boolean[len1 + 1][len2 + 1];

        // Start the recursion
        return isInterleaveHelper(s1, s2, s3, 0, 0, 0, memo);
    }

    private boolean isInterleaveHelper(String s1, String s2, String s3, int i, int j, int k, Boolean[][] memo) {
        // If we have reached the end of s3, return true
        if (k == s3.length()) {
            return true;
        }

        // If the result has already been computed, return it
        if (memo[i][j] != null) {
            return memo[i][j];
        }

        // Check if we can take a character from s1
        boolean takeS1 = (i < s1.length() && s1.charAt(i) == s3.charAt(k)) && 
                          isInterleaveHelper(s1, s2, s3, i + 1, j, k + 1, memo);

        // Check if we can take a character from s2
        boolean takeS2 = (j < s2.length() && s2.charAt(j) == s3.charAt(k)) && 
                          isInterleaveHelper(s1, s2, s3, i, j + 1, k + 1, memo);

        // Store the result in the memo table and return it
        memo[i][j] = takeS1 || takeS2;
        return memo[i][j];
    }
}
