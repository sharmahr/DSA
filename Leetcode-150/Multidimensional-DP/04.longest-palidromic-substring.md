# Intuition
To find the longest palindrome substring in a given string, one effective approach is to use the technique of expanding around center. This approach efficiently checks for palindromes by expanding from each character or pair of characters that might be the center of a palindrome.

# Approach
1. **Expand Around Center Technique**:
   - Iterate through each character in the string `s`. For each character, treat it as the center of a potential palindrome.
   - Consider both odd-length palindromes (where the center is a single character) and even-length palindromes (where the center is between two characters).
   - Expand outward from the center as long as the characters on both sides are equal.
   - Track the length and the actual substring whenever a longer palindrome is found compared to the previously recorded one.

2. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize variables to keep track of the maximum length of palindromes found (`resultLength`) and the substring itself (`result`).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the length of the string `s` is less than 2, it's trivially a palindrome.

4. **Complexity**:
   - **Time Complexity**: \( O(n^2) \), where \( n \) is the length of the input string `s`. This is because expanding around each character takes linear time, and there are \( 2n - 1 \) possible centers.
   - **Space Complexity**: \( O(1) \) additional space, as only a constant amount of extra space is used besides the input string.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public String longestPalindrome(String s) {
        int length = s.length();
        
        if (length < 2) {
            return s;
        }
        
        int resultLength = 0;
        String result = "";
        
        for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            // Odd length palindromes centered at i
            int left = i, right = i;
            while (left >= 0 && right < length && s.charAt(left) == s.charAt(right)) {
                int currentLength = right - left + 1;
                if (currentLength > resultLength) {
                    resultLength = currentLength;
                    result = s.substring(left, right + 1);
                }
                left--;
                right++;
            }
            
            // Even length palindromes centered between i and i+1
            left = i;
            right = i + 1;
            while (left >= 0 && right < length && s.charAt(left) == s.charAt(right)) {
                int currentLength = right - left + 1;
                if (currentLength > resultLength) {
                    resultLength = currentLength;
                    result = s.substring(left, right + 1);
                }
                left--;
                right++;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
