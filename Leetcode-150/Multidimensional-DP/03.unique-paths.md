[Unique Paths](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-ii/description/) 

# Intuition
The problem requires finding the number of unique paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of a grid, where some cells may contain obstacles. Obstacles block the path and cannot be crossed. This can be efficiently solved using dynamic programming.

# Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: We use a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of unique paths to reach cell `(i, j)` from the top-left corner `(0, 0)` of the grid.
2. **Initialization**:
   - Start by initializing `dp[0][0]` to 1 if the starting point `(0, 0)` is not an obstacle (`obstacleGrid[0][0] == 0`).
   - Fill the first row and first column of `dp`:
     - For the first row, if there's no obstacle and there's a path from the previous cell (`dp[0][j-1] != 0`), set `dp[0][j]` to 1.
     - For the first column, if there's no obstacle and there's a path from the cell above (`dp[i-1][0] != 0`), set `dp[i][0]` to 1.
3. **Fill the rest of the dp table**:
   - For each cell `(i, j)` in the grid (starting from `(1, 1)`), compute `dp[i][j]` based on whether there's an obstacle at `(i, j)`.
   - If there's no obstacle, add paths from the cell directly above `(i-1, j)` and from the cell directly to the left `(i, j-1)`.
   - If there's an obstacle, set `dp[i][j]` to 0 since no paths can pass through obstacles.
4. **Result**: The value `dp[m-1][n-1]` (where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns) will contain the number of unique paths from the top-left to the bottom-right corner of the grid.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: \( O(m \times n) \), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid. We iterate through each cell of the grid exactly once.
- Space complexity: \( O(m \times n) \) due to the use of the `dp` array of the same size as the input grid.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int uniquePathsWithObstacles(int[][] obstacleGrid) {
        int m = obstacleGrid.length;
        int n = obstacleGrid[0].length;
        
        // Edge case: if the starting position or ending position is an obstacle, return 0
        if (obstacleGrid[0][0] == 1 || obstacleGrid[m-1][n-1] == 1) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        // DP array to store number of unique paths to each cell
        int[][] dp = new int[m][n];
        
        // Initialize the starting point
        dp[0][0] = 1;
        
        // Fill the first row (only right moves)
        for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
            if (obstacleGrid[0][j] == 0 && dp[0][j-1] != 0) {
                dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1];
            }
        }
        
        // Fill the first column (only down moves)
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            if (obstacleGrid[i][0] == 0 && dp[i-1][0] != 0) {
                dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0];
            }
        }
        
        // Fill the rest of the DP table
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (obstacleGrid[i][j] == 0) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1];
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = 0; // No paths through obstacles
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[m-1][n-1];
    }
}
```

### Recursive Approach with Memoization:

1. **Base Case**: If the starting point `(0, 0)` is an obstacle (`obstacleGrid[0][0] == 1`), return `0`.
   
2. **Recursive Function**: Define a recursive function `dfs` that takes the current position `(i, j)` in the grid and returns the number of unique paths to reach `(i, j)` from `(0, 0)`.

3. **Memoization**: Use a memoization array `memo` where `memo[i][j]` stores the number of unique paths to reach `(i, j)`. Initialize `memo[i][j]` to `-1` to indicate that the state `(i, j)` has not been computed yet.

4. **Recursive Exploration**:
   - If `memo[i][j]` is not `-1`, return `memo[i][j]`.
   - If the current cell `(i, j)` is an obstacle (`obstacleGrid[i][j] == 1`), set `memo[i][j] = 0` and return `0`.
   - Otherwise, recursively explore paths from `(i+1, j)` (downward) and `(i, j+1)` (rightward). Update `memo[i][j]` with the sum of paths from these two directions.
   
5. **Initialization and Result**: Start the recursion from `(0, 0)` and return `dfs(0, 0)`.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: The recursion explores each cell at most once, resulting in a time complexity of \(O(m \times n)\), where \(m\) is the number of rows and \(n\) is the number of columns in the grid.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(m \times n)\) for the memoization array `memo`.

### Implementation:

Here's how you can implement the recursive solution with memoization in Java:

```java
class Solution {
    public int uniquePathsWithObstacles(int[][] obstacleGrid) {
        int m = obstacleGrid.length;
        int n = obstacleGrid[0].length;
        
        // Memoization array
        int[][] memo = new int[m][n];
        for (int[] row : memo) {
            Arrays.fill(row, -1); // Initialize with -1 (unvisited)
        }
        
        // Recursive function with memoization
        return dfs(0, 0, obstacleGrid, memo);
    }
    
    private int dfs(int i, int j, int[][] obstacleGrid, int[][] memo) {
        int m = obstacleGrid.length;
        int n = obstacleGrid[0].length;
        
        // Base case: reached the bottom-right corner
        if (i == m - 1 && j == n - 1) {
            return 1;
        }
        
        // Check memoization table
        if (memo[i][j] != -1) {
            return memo[i][j];
        }
        
        // If current cell is obstacle, no paths through it
        if (obstacleGrid[i][j] == 1) {
            memo[i][j] = 0;
            return 0;
        }
        
        // Calculate paths by moving right or down
        int paths = 0;
        if (i + 1 < m) {
            paths += dfs(i + 1, j, obstacleGrid, memo); // Move downward
        }
        if (j + 1 < n) {
            paths += dfs(i, j + 1, obstacleGrid, memo); // Move rightward
        }
        
        // Memoize the result
        memo[i][j] = paths;
        return paths;
    }
}
```
