[Maximum Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-path-sum)

# Intuition
The problem requires finding the minimum path sum from the top-left to the bottom-right of a grid, where movement is allowed only down or right at any point. This can be efficiently solved using dynamic programming.

# Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming**: We use a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum path sum to reach cell `(i, j)` from the top-left corner `(0, 0)` of the grid.
2. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize `dp[0][0]` to `grid[0][0]`, as the path sum to the starting point is just its own value.
   - Fill the first row and first column of `dp` by accumulating the values from the left or above respectively, since there's only one direction to arrive at these cells.
3. **Fill the rest of the dp table**:
   - For each cell `(i, j)` in the grid (starting from `(1, 1)`), compute `dp[i][j]` as the minimum of `dp[i-1][j]` (top cell) and `dp[i][j-1]` (left cell), plus the value of `grid[i][j]`.
4. **Result**: The value `dp[m-1][n-1]` (where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns) will contain the minimum path sum from the top-left to the bottom-right corner of the grid.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: \( O(m \times n) \), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid. We iterate through each cell of the grid exactly once.
- Space complexity: \( O(m \times n) \) due to the use of the `dp` array of the same size as the input grid.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int minPathSum(int[][] grid) {
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;
        
        // Initialize dp array
        int[][] dp = new int[m][n];
        dp[0][0] = grid[0][0];
        
        // Fill the first row
        for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
            dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] + grid[0][j];
        }
        
        // Fill the first column
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + grid[i][0];
        }
        
        // Fill the rest of the dp table
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j];
            }
        }
        
        // The result is stored in dp[m-1][n-1]
        return dp[m-1][n-1];
    }
}
```


### Recursive Approach

In the recursive approach, we define a function `minPathSumRecursive(int[][] grid, int i, int j)` that computes the minimum path sum from cell `(i, j)` to the bottom-right corner of the grid. The idea is to recursively explore all possible paths from each cell to the destination and return the minimum of these paths.

- **Base Case**: If we are at the bottom-right corner `(m-1, n-1)`, return `grid[m-1][n-1]`.
- **Recursive Case**: From any cell `(i, j)`, we can either move down `(i+1, j)` or move right `(i, j+1)`. The minimum path sum to reach `(i, j)` is the current cell's value plus the minimum of the path sums from its two possible moves.
  
- **Memoization**: Use a 2D array `memo` to store computed results to avoid redundant calculations.

### Memoized Recursive Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int minPathSum(int[][] grid) {
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;
        int[][] memo = new int[m][n];
        
        // Initialize memoization array with -1 (indicating not computed)
        for (int[] row : memo) {
            Arrays.fill(row, -1);
        }
        
        // Call the recursive function
        return minPathSumRecursive(grid, 0, 0, memo);
    }
    
    private int minPathSumRecursive(int[][] grid, int i, int j, int[][] memo) {
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;
        
        // Base case: if we reach the bottom-right corner
        if (i == m - 1 && j == n - 1) {
            return grid[i][j];
        }
        
        // Check memoization
        if (memo[i][j] != -1) {
            return memo[i][j];
        }
        
        // Calculate minimum path sum recursively
        int minPathSum = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        if (i < m - 1) {
            minPathSum = Math.min(minPathSum, minPathSumRecursive(grid, i + 1, j, memo));
        }
        if (j < n - 1) {
            minPathSum = Math.min(minPathSum, minPathSumRecursive(grid, i, j + 1, memo));
        }
        
        // Memoize the result
        memo[i][j] = grid[i][j] + minPathSum;
        return memo[i][j];
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Memoized Recursive Solution

- We initialize a `memo` array with dimensions equal to the grid size, filled with `-1` to indicate that results haven't been computed yet.
- The `minPathSum` function takes the current position `(i, j)` and computes the minimum path sum recursively by exploring down `(i+1, j)` and right `(i, j+1)`.
- Base case checks if we've reached the bottom-right corner, returning the value at that position.
- Memoization checks if the result for `(i, j)` has already been computed. If yes, it returns the memoized result; otherwise, it computes it recursively and memoizes the result for future use.
- Finally, the `minPathSum` function is called with initial parameters `(0, 0)` to start computing from the top-left corner of the grid.
