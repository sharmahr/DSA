[Best Time to Buy and Sell Stocks 4](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iv)

# Intuition
The problem requires maximizing profit by performing at most \( k \) transactions in a sequence of stock prices. If \( k \) is sufficiently large relative to the number of days \( n \), we can treat the problem similarly to the case of unlimited transactions (where we can buy and sell on the same day if it's profitable). Otherwise, we need an efficient dynamic programming solution to track the maximum profit up to each day with up to \( k \) transactions.

# Approach
1. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If \( k \) is greater than or equal to \( n/2 \), we can perform as many transactions as we want (since buying and selling require two consecutive days, and each transaction consists of both).

2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**:
   - Use a 2D array `dp[i][j]` where:
     - \( i \) represents the day index (from 0 to \( n-1 \)).
     - \( j \) represents the number of transactions performed (from 0 to \( k \)).
   - `dp[i][j]` will store the maximum profit achievable up to day \( i \) with \( j \) transactions.

3. **Transition Formula**:
   - For each day \( i \) and each transaction count \( j \):
     - `dp[i][j]` can be computed using:
       - `dp[i-1][j]`: Maximum profit without conducting any transaction on day \( i \).
       - `prices[i] + maxDiff`: Profit by selling on day \( i \), where `maxDiff` represents the maximum profit that can be made with \( j-1 \) transactions up to day \( i-1 \).

4. **Updating `maxDiff`**:
   - `maxDiff` is updated to consider the maximum profit from the previous day with \( j-1 \) transactions minus the price of the current day. This ensures that we're maintaining the best profit potential if we decide to conduct a transaction on day \( i \).

5. **Result**:
   - The result is stored in `dp[n-1][k]`, which represents the maximum profit achievable up to the last day with \( k \) transactions.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n \cdot k) \). We iterate over \( n \) days and for each day, we compute the maximum profit for up to \( k \) transactions.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(n \cdot k) \) for the `dp` array. 

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int k, int[] prices) {
        int n = prices.length;
        
        // If k is large or prices is empty, we can do as many transactions as we want
        if (k >= n / 2) {
            return maxProfitUnlimitedTransactions(prices);
        }
        
        // dp[i][j]: maximum profit up to day i with j transactions
        int[][] dp = new int[n][k + 1];
        
        for (int j = 1; j <= k; j++) {
            int maxDiff = -prices[0];
            for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i-1][j], prices[i] + maxDiff);
                maxDiff = Math.max(maxDiff, dp[i-1][j-1] - prices[i]);
            }
        }
        
        return dp[n-1][k];
    }
    
    private int maxProfitUnlimitedTransactions(int[] prices) {
        int maxProfit = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
            if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1]) {
                maxProfit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1];
            }
        }
        return maxProfit;
    }
}
```

### Recursive Approach with Memoization

1. **Define the Recursive Function**: 
   - Define a recursive function `maxProfitRecursive(int[] prices, int k, int index, int[][] memo)` that computes the maximum profit starting from day `index` with `k` transactions remaining.

2. **Base Case**:
   - If `k == 0` or `index >= prices.length`, return `0` because no transactions can be made.
   
3. **Memoization**:
   - Use a 2D array `memo` where `memo[index][k]` stores the computed maximum profit starting from day `index` with `k` transactions remaining.
   - Before computing the recursive call, check if the result for the current state has already been computed and stored in `memo`. If yes, return the memoized result.

4. **Recursive Case**:
   - For each day `index`, there are two choices:
     - Skip the current day: `maxProfitRecursive(prices, k, index + 1, memo)`
     - Perform a transaction on the current day: Calculate the maximum profit by selling on day `i` after buying on any previous day `j`, where `j < i`. This involves updating the `maxProfit` by subtracting the price difference and recursively calculating the profit for the remaining transactions.

5. **Compute the Final Result**:
   - Call `maxProfitRecursive(prices, k, 0, memo)` to get the maximum profit starting from day `0` with `k` transactions.

Here's the Java code implementing the recursive and memoized solution:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int k, int[] prices) {
        int n = prices.length;
        // If k is large, use unlimited transactions logic
        if (k >= n / 2) {
            return maxProfitUnlimitedTransactions(prices);
        }
        
        // Memoization array
        int[][] memo = new int[n][k + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            Arrays.fill(memo[i], -1);
        }
        
        return maxProfitRecursive(prices, k, 0, memo);
    }
    
    private int maxProfitRecursive(int[] prices, int k, int index, int[][] memo) {
        // Base case
        if (k == 0 || index >= prices.length) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        // Check memoization
        if (memo[index][k] != -1) {
            return memo[index][k];
        }
        
        // Skip current day
        int maxProfit = maxProfitRecursive(prices, k, index + 1, memo);
        
        // Buy on current day and sell on any future day
        for (int i = index + 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
            int profit = prices[i] - prices[index];
            if (profit > 0) {
                maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, profit + maxProfitRecursive(prices, k - 1, i + 1, memo));
            }
        }
        
        // Memoize the result
        memo[index][k] = maxProfit;
        return maxProfit;
    }
    
    private int maxProfitUnlimitedTransactions(int[] prices) {
        int maxProfit = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
            if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1]) {
                maxProfit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1];
            }
        }
        return maxProfit;
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code:

- **maxProfit method**: 
  - Checks if `k` is sufficiently large to use unlimited transaction logic (`k >= n / 2`).
  - Initializes the `memo` array and calls `maxProfitRecursive` with initial parameters.

- **maxProfitRecursive method**:
  - Base case checks if no transactions are allowed (`k == 0`) or if we've reached the end of the prices array (`index >= prices.length`).
  - Memoization check avoids redundant calculations.
  - Recursively computes the maximum profit by either skipping the current day or performing a transaction starting from the current day and updating the memoization array.

- **maxProfitUnlimitedTransactions method**:
  - Computes the maximum profit possible with unlimited transactions by summing up all positive price differences.
