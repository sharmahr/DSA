# Intuition
The problem is to find the minimum path sum from the top to the bottom of a triangle of numbers, where each step can move to the adjacent numbers on the row below. 

# Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming**: We can solve this problem using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach.
2. **Initialization**: Start by initializing an array `dp` to store the minimum path sums for each position in the triangle's rows. Begin by initializing `dp` with the last row of the triangle.
3. **Bottom-Up Calculation**: Traverse the triangle from the second-last row to the top. For each position in the current row, update `dp[j]` to be the sum of the current element and the minimum of the two adjacent elements in the row directly below it.
4. **Result**: After processing all rows, `dp[0]` will contain the minimum path sum from the top to the bottom of the triangle.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: \( O(n^2) \), where \( n \) is the number of rows in the triangle. This is because we iterate through each element in the triangle and perform constant-time operations to update the `dp` array.
- Space complexity: \( O(n) \) for the `dp` array, where \( n \) is the number of rows in the triangle. We use a linear space array to store the minimum path sums.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumTotal(List<List<Integer>> triangle) {
        int n = triangle.size();
        int[] dp = new int[n];
        
        // Initialize dp array with the last row of triangle
        List<Integer> lastRow = triangle.get(n - 1);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i] = lastRow.get(i);
        }
        
        // Bottom-up approach to calculate minimum path sum
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            List<Integer> currentRow = triangle.get(i);
            for (int j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
                dp[j] = currentRow.get(j) + Math.min(dp[j], dp[j + 1]);
            }
        }
        
        return dp[0];
    }
}
```

### Recursive Approach with Memoization

In this approach, we'll use recursion to explore all possible paths from the top to the bottom of the triangle. To avoid recalculating results for the same subproblems, we'll use memoization (caching results of already computed subproblems).

#### Intuition
- Use a recursive function `minimumTotalRecursive` that computes the minimum path sum starting from a given position `(i, j)` in the triangle.
- Base Case: If we are at the bottom of the triangle (`i` equals the height of the triangle), return the value at `(i, j)`.
- Recursive Case: For any other position `(i, j)`, compute the minimum path sum by considering the current element plus the minimum of the results from moving to the adjacent positions in the next row below.

#### Memoization
- Use a 2D array `memo` to store the results of already computed subproblems. This ensures that we do not recompute results for the same position in the triangle multiple times.

#### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n^2) \), where \( n \) is the number of rows in the triangle. This is because each position in the triangle is computed once.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(n^2) \) due to the space used by the `memo` array.

Here's the code implementing the recursive approach with memoization:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int minimumTotal(List<List<Integer>> triangle) {
        int n = triangle.size();
        int[][] memo = new int[n][n];
        return minimumTotalRecursive(triangle, 0, 0, memo);
    }
    
    private int minimumTotalRecursive(List<List<Integer>> triangle, int i, int j, int[][] memo) {
        // Base case: if we are at the bottom of the triangle
        if (i == triangle.size() - 1) {
            return triangle.get(i).get(j);
        }
        
        // Check memoization table
        if (memo[i][j] > 0) {
            return memo[i][j];
        }
        
        // Recursive case: calculate minimum path sum
        int left = minimumTotalRecursive(triangle, i + 1, j, memo);
        int right = minimumTotalRecursive(triangle, i + 1, j + 1, memo);
        
        // Memoize the result
        memo[i][j] = triangle.get(i).get(j) + Math.min(left, right);
        
        return memo[i][j];
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: We initialize a `memo` array of size `n x n` to store computed results. The `memo[i][j]` will store the minimum path sum starting from position `(i, j)` in the triangle.
   
2. **Recursive Function**: `minimumTotalRecursive` takes parameters `(i, j)` which represents the current position in the triangle. It recursively calculates the minimum path sum by considering the current element plus the minimum of the results from moving to the adjacent positions in the next row below.

3. **Base Case**: If we reach the bottom of the triangle (`i == triangle.size() - 1`), return the value at `(i, j)`.

4. **Memoization**: Before performing any calculations, check if the result for `(i, j)` is already computed and stored in the `memo` array. If it is, return the memoized result; otherwise, compute it recursively, store it in `memo`, and return.

5. **Return**: Finally, return `memo[0][0]` which contains the minimum path sum from the top to the bottom of the triangle.
