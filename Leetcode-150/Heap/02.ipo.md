# Intuition
The problem requires selecting projects to maximize capital while respecting constraints on the number of projects and available initial capital. Using a greedy approach where we always select the most profitable project we can afford seems suitable, especially when coupled with efficient data structures like a max heap to quickly retrieve the highest profit project.

# Approach
1. **Initialization**:
   - Convert the input arrays into a list of `Project` objects where each project has a profit and required capital.
   
2. **Sorting**:
   - Sort the list of projects based on their required capital. This allows us to process projects in order of increasing capital requirement.

3. **Max Heap (PriorityQueue)**:
   - Use a max heap to keep track of the profits of projects that we can currently afford (i.e., their capital requirement is less than or equal to our current capital \( w \)).
   - This allows us to efficiently select the project with the maximum profit that is feasible.

4. **Greedy Selection**:
   - Iterate up to \( k \) times (or until no more projects can be selected).
   - In each iteration, add feasible projects (those with capital less than or equal to \( w \)) to the max heap.
   - If the heap is not empty, select the project with the maximum profit from the heap, add its profit to \( w \), and repeat.
   - Stop if no more projects can be selected or if \( k \) projects have been selected.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - Handle cases where no projects can be selected (if \( k = 0 \)).
   - Handle cases where all projects require more capital than available \( w \).

# Complexity
- Time complexity: \( O(n \log n + k \log n) \), where \( n \) is the number of projects. Sorting takes \( O(n \log n) \) and adding/removing from the heap takes \( O(k \log n) \) in the worst case.
- Space complexity: \( O(n) \) for storing the list of projects and \( O(n) \) for the max heap.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int findMaximizedCapital(int k, int w, int[] profits, int[] capital) {
        int n = profits.length;
        
        // Create project objects
        Project[] projects = new Project[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            projects[i] = new Project(profits[i], capital[i]);
        }
        
        // Sort projects based on capital required
        Arrays.sort(projects, (a, b) -> a.capital - b.capital);
        
        // Max heap to store profits of available projects
        PriorityQueue<Integer> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> b - a);
        
        int index = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            // Add all projects with capital <= w to max heap
            while (index < n && projects[index].capital <= w) {
                maxHeap.offer(projects[index].profit);
                index++;
            }
            
            // If we can take a project
            if (!maxHeap.isEmpty()) {
                w += maxHeap.poll();
            } else {
                break; // No more projects can be selected
            }
        }
        
        return w;
    }
    
    // Helper class to represent each project
    class Project {
        int profit;
        int capital;
        
        public Project(int profit, int capital) {
            this.profit = profit;
            this.capital = capital;
        }
    }
}
