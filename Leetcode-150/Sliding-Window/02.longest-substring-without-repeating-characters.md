[Longest Substring without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

# Intuition
The problem requires finding the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. The immediate thought is to use a sliding window approach, where we maintain a window that keeps track of the characters currently in the substring. As we expand the window, we check for duplicates and adjust the window accordingly.

# Approach
1. **Sliding Window Technique**: Use two pointers (`left` and `right`) to represent the current window in the string.
2. **Use a Set for Characters**: Utilize a `Set` to keep track of characters in the current window. This helps in quickly checking for duplicates.
3. **Expand Window**: Move the `right` pointer to the right, adding the character at `right` to the set if it's not already present.
4. **Adjust Window on Duplicate**: If a duplicate is found (i.e., the character at `right` is already in the set), move the `left` pointer to the right until the duplicate is removed from the set.
5. **Update Maximum Length**: During each step, update the maximum length of the substring found so far.
6. **Return Result**: The result is the maximum length of substring without repeating characters.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$, where $$n$$ is the length of the string `s`. Each character is processed at most twice (once by each pointer), leading to linear time complexity.
- Space complexity: $$O(min(n, m))$$, where $$m$$ is the size of the character set. In the worst case, the set will store all characters in the string, but typically it's constrained by the number of unique characters.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int maxLength = 0;
        Set<Character> charSet = new HashSet<>();
        int left = 0;
        
        for (int right = 0; right < n; right++) {
            while (charSet.contains(s.charAt(right))) {
                charSet.remove(s.charAt(left));
                left++;
            }
            charSet.add(s.charAt(right));
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
        }
        
        return maxLength;
    }
}
