[Minimum Size Subarray Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

# Intuition
The problem requires finding the minimum length of a contiguous subarray in which the sum is greater than or equal to a given target value. This is a classic sliding window problem where we maintain a window of elements and adjust it based on the sum of elements inside the window.

# Approach
1. **Sliding Window Technique**: Use two pointers (`left` and `right`) to represent the current window in the array.
2. **Expand and Contract Window**:
   - Expand the window by moving the `right` pointer to the right and add the element `nums[right]` to the current sum.
   - If the current sum is greater than or equal to the target, calculate the current window size (`right - left + 1`).
   - Update the minimum length found so far (`min`) if the current window size is smaller.
   - Contract the window by moving the `left` pointer to the right until the sum is less than the target, adjusting the sum accordingly (`sum -= nums[left]`).
3. **Track Minimum Length**: Throughout the process, keep track of the minimum length of the subarray meeting the condition.
4. **Edge Case**: If no such subarray exists where the sum is greater than or equal to the target, return `0`.
5. **Return Result**: Return the minimum length found.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$, where $$n$$ is the number of elements in the `nums` array. Each element is processed at most twice (once by each pointer), leading to linear time complexity.
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$, as we use only a constant amount of extra space for variables.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int minSubArrayLen(int target, int[] nums) {
        int left = 0, right = 0;
        int sum = 0, min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        
        while (right < nums.length) {
            sum += nums[right];
            
            while (sum >= target) {
                min = Math.min(min, right - left + 1);
                sum -= nums[left];
                left++;
            }
            
            right++;
        }
        
        return min == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? 0 : min;
    }
}
