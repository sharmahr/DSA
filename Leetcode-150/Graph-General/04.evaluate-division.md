[Evaluate Division](https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-division)

# Intuition
The problem can be thought of as evaluating division operations over a graph where nodes represent variables and edges represent division results. By constructing a graph from the given equations and their corresponding values, we can use depth-first search (DFS) to find a path from the dividend to the divisor in each query, thereby computing the result.

# Approach
1. **Graph Construction**: Build a graph where each node represents a variable and each directed edge represents the division result between two variables. For example, the equation "a / b = 2.0" would be represented by an edge from node "a" to node "b" with a weight of 2.0 and an edge from "b" to "a" with a weight of 1/2.0.
2. **Query Processing**: For each query, use DFS to find a path from the dividend to the divisor. If a path is found, the product of the edge weights along the path gives the result of the division. If no path exists, return -1.0.
3. **Special Cases**: Handle cases where the dividend or divisor does not exist in the graph, or where the dividend and divisor are the same.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
  - Graph construction: $$O(E)$$ where $$E$$ is the number of equations.
  - Each query: Worst case $$O(V + E)$$ where $$V$$ is the number of variables and $$E$$ is the number of edges.
  - Overall: $$O(E + Q \times (V + E))$$ where $$Q$$ is the number of queries.
* Space complexity: 
  - Graph storage: $$O(V + E)$$
  - DFS recursion stack and visited set: $$O(V)$$
