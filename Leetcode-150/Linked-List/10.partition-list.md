[Partition List](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-list)

# Intuition
To partition a linked list around a value \(x\) such that all nodes less than \(x\) come before nodes greater than or equal to \(x\), the first thought is to use two separate lists: one for elements smaller than \(x\) and one for elements greater than or equal to \(x\). These lists can then be concatenated to produce the desired result.

# Approach
1. Create two dummy nodes to serve as the heads of two separate lists: one for nodes with values less than \(x\) and one for nodes with values greater than or equal to \(x\).
2. Traverse the original list and append nodes to the appropriate list based on their values.
3. Once the traversal is complete, concatenate the two lists.
4. Return the head of the concatenated list.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$, where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the linked list. Each node is visited once.
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$, as the algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space (excluding the input and output).

# Code
```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode partition(ListNode head, int x) {
        ListNode dummySmaller = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode dummyLarger = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode smaller = dummySmaller;
        ListNode larger = dummyLarger;
        
        while (head != null) {
            if (head.val < x) {
                smaller.next = head;
                smaller = smaller.next;
            } else {
                larger.next = head;
                larger = larger.next;
            }
            head = head.next;
        }
        
        // Prevent a cycle in the linked list
        larger.next = null;
        
        // Connect the two lists
        smaller.next = dummyLarger.next;
        
        return dummySmaller.next;
    }
}
