[Reverse Linked List 2](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list-ii)

# Intuition
The problem requires reversing a portion of a linked list between two given positions, `left` and `right`. The main idea is to traverse the list until the `left` position, reverse the sublist from `left` to `right`, and then reconnect the reversed sublist back to the main list.

# Approach
1. Use a dummy node to simplify edge cases, such as when the reversal starts from the head.
2. Traverse the list to reach the node just before the `left` position (`prev` node).
3. Use three pointers (`prev`, `start`, and `then`) to reverse the sublist:
   - `prev` points to the node just before the sublist to be reversed.
   - `start` points to the first node of the sublist to be reversed.
   - `then` points to the node that will be moved to the front of the sublist in each iteration.
4. In each iteration, move the `then` node to the front of the sublist and adjust the pointers accordingly.
5. Return the new head of the list after all modifications.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$, where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the linked list. The algorithm traverses the list and performs the reversal in a single pass.
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$, as the algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseBetween(ListNode head, int left, int right) {
        if (head == null || head.next == null || left == right) {
            return head;
        }
        
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
        dummy.next = head;
        ListNode prev = dummy;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < left; i++) {
            prev = prev.next;
        }
        
        ListNode start = prev.next;
        ListNode then = start.next;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < right - left; i++) {
            start.next = then.next;
            then.next = prev.next;
            prev.next = then;
            then = start.next;
        }
        
        return dummy.next;
    }
}
