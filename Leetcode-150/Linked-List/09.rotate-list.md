[Rotate List](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-list)

# Intuition
To solve the problem of rotating a linked list to the right by `k` places, the first thought is to recognize that rotating the list effectively means reconnecting the end of the list to the beginning and breaking the connection at the appropriate position. This can be visualized by turning the list into a circular linked list and then breaking it at the new tail position.

# Approach
1. **Calculate the length of the list (`n`)**: Traverse the list to determine its length and find the last node.
2. **Connect the last node to the head**: This will form a circular linked list.
3. **Determine the new head position**: Calculate the position of the new head after the rotation using the formula `(n - (k % n))`. This gives the number of steps to move from the original head to the new tail.
4. **Break the circular list**: Traverse to the new tail position, break the list by setting the next pointer of the new tail to null.
5. **Return the new head**: The node following the new tail becomes the new head of the list.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$, where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the linked list. The algorithm traverses the list to calculate its length and determine the new head position.
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$, as the algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode rotateRight(ListNode head, int k) {
        // Handle edge cases
        if (head == null || head.next == null) return head;
        
        // Calculate the length of the list
        ListNode current = head;
        int n = 1;
        while (current.next != null) {
            n++;
            current = current.next;
        }
        
        // Connect the last node to the first node to form a circular list
        current.next = head;
        
        // Calculate the new tail position
        int limit = n - (k % n);
        
        // Traverse to the new tail
        current = head;
        for (int i = 1; i < limit; i++) {
            current = current.next;
        }
        
        // Set the new head and break the circular list
        ListNode newHead = current.next;
        current.next = null;
        
        return newHead;
    }
}
