[Remove duplicates from sorted list 2](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list-ii)

# Intuition
To solve the problem of removing duplicates from a sorted linked list, the first thought is to traverse the list and compare each node with its next node. If duplicates are found, skip all nodes that have the same value to ensure only distinct numbers remain.

# Approach
1. Create a dummy node to handle edge cases easily and point its next to the head of the list.
2. Use two pointers:
   - `prev` to keep track of the last node before the sequence of duplicates.
   - `current` to traverse the list.
3. Iterate through the list:
   - If the `current` node is the last node or its value differs from the next node, move the `prev` pointer to `current` and move `current` to the next node.
   - If the `current` node has the same value as the next node, iterate through the duplicates until a distinct node is found, then connect the `prev` node's next to this distinct node.
4. Return the list starting from the dummy node's next.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$, where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the linked list. The algorithm traverses the list once.
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$, as the algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }

class Solution {
    public ListNode deleteDuplicates(ListNode head) {
        ListNode result = new ListNode(-1);
        result.next = head;
        ListNode prev = result;
        ListNode current = head;

        while (current != null) {
            if (current.next == null || current.val != current.next.val) {
                prev = current;
                current = current.next;
            } else {
                // Remove the nodes
                while (current.next != null && current.val == current.next.val) {
                    current = current.next;
                }
                prev.next = current.next;
                current = current.next;
            }
        }
        return result.next;
    }
}
