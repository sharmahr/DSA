[Search Insert Position](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position)

# Intuition
The problem involves finding the position to insert a target value in a sorted array, ensuring the array remains sorted. The immediate thought is to use binary search due to its efficiency in searching sorted arrays.

# Approach
1. **Binary Search**: Use binary search to find the target value or determine the appropriate insertion position.
2. **Initialization**: Set the left and right pointers to the start and end of the array, respectively.
3. **Iteration**: While the left pointer is less than or equal to the right pointer:
    - Calculate the mid index.
    - If the mid value equals the target, return the mid index.
    - If the target is greater than the mid value, adjust the left pointer to mid + 1.
    - If the target is less than the mid value, adjust the right pointer to mid - 1.
4. **Return**: If the target is not found, return the left pointer as the insertion position.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
  - $$O(\log n)$$ due to the binary search approach.
- Space complexity: 
  - $$O(1)$$ as we are using a constant amount of space.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int searchInsert(int[] nums, int target) {
        int left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;
        int mid = 0;
        while(left <= right){
            mid = left + (right - left)/2;
            if(nums[mid] == target){
                return mid;
            }else if(target > nums[mid]){
                left = mid + 1;
            }else if(target < nums[mid]){
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return left;
    }
}
