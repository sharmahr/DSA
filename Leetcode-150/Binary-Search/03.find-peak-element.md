[Find the Peak Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element)

# Intuition
The problem is about finding any peak element in an array, where a peak element is defined as an element that is greater than its neighbors (if they exist). Given the sorted nature of the array, an efficient approach is to use binary search to minimize the number of comparisons.

# Approach
1. **Binary Search**: Utilize binary search to efficiently find a peak element.
2. **Initialization**: Initialize pointers `left` and `right` to the start and end of the array, respectively.
3. **Midpoint Calculation**: Calculate the midpoint `mid` of the current segment.
4. **Peak Check**: Check if `nums[mid]` is a peak:
   - If `mid` is at the boundaries of the array (`mid == 0` or `mid == nums.length - 1`), it automatically qualifies as a peak.
   - Otherwise, check if `nums[mid]` is greater than or equal to its neighbors (`nums[mid-1]` and `nums[mid+1]`).
5. **Binary Search Direction**:
   - If `nums[mid] < nums[mid+1]`, move the `left` pointer to `mid + 1` to search in the right half.
   - Otherwise, move the `right` pointer to `mid - 1` to search in the left half.
6. **Termination**: The loop terminates when `left` equals `right`, indicating the peak element has been found.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
  - $$O(\log n)$$ due to binary search.
- Space complexity:
  - $$O(1)$$ as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int findPeakElement(int[] nums) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.length - 1;

        // Handle the case of an empty array
        if (right < 0) {
            return -1; // No peak in an empty array
        }

        // Binary search for the peak element
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

            // Check if mid is a peak
            if ((mid == 0 || nums[mid] >= nums[mid - 1]) && (mid == nums.length - 1 || nums[mid] >= nums[mid + 1])) {
                return mid;
            } else if (nums[mid] < nums[mid + 1]) {
                // Peak must be on the right side
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                // Peak must be on the left side
                right = mid;
            }
        }

        // If left == right, it's the peak element
        return left;
    }
}
