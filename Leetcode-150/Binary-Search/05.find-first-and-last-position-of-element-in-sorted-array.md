[Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-first-and-last-position-of-element-in-sorted-array)

# Intuition
The problem requires finding the first and last positions of a target element in a sorted array. Given that the array is sorted, binary search can be leveraged to efficiently locate these positions.

# Approach
1. **Binary Search for First Occurrence**: Implement a binary search variant (`findFirst`) to find the leftmost occurrence of the target element.
   - Adjust the `right` pointer if the current middle element is greater than or equal to the target.
   - Update `left` pointer otherwise.
   - Check if the current element equals the target and if it's the leftmost occurrence (either it's the first element or the previous element is not the target).
2. **Binary Search for Last Occurrence**: Implement another binary search variant (`findLast`) to find the rightmost occurrence of the target element.
   - Adjust the `right` pointer if the current middle element is greater than the target.
   - Update `left` pointer otherwise.
   - Check if the current element equals the target and if it's the rightmost occurrence (either it's the last element or the next element is not the target).
3. **Edge Case Handling**: Handle cases where the target is not found by returning `-1` for both `findFirst` and `findLast`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
  - $$O(\log n)$$ for each binary search (total $$O(\log n)$$ for both `findFirst` and `findLast`).
- Space complexity:
  - $$O(1)$$ as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] searchRange(int[] nums, int target) {
        return new int[]{findFirst(nums, target), findLast(nums, target)};
    }

    public int findFirst(int[] nums, int target) {
        int left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

            if (nums[mid] == target && (mid == 0 || nums[mid - 1] != target)) {
                return mid;
            } else if (nums[mid] >= target) {
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }

    public int findLast(int[] nums, int target) {
        int left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

            if (nums[mid] == target && (mid == nums.length - 1 || nums[mid + 1] != target)) {
                return mid;
            } else if (nums[mid] > target) {
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
