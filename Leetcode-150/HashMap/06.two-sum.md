[Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

# Intuition
To solve the Two Sum problem, we can use a hashmap to store the elements of the array along with their indices. By doing so, we can quickly check if the complement (target - current element) exists in the hashmap. If it does, we have found the required pair of numbers.

To remember this solution, think of using a hashmap to store the array elements and their indices, and then searching for the complement of each element in the hashmap.

# Approach
1. Create an empty hashmap called `map` to store the array elements as keys and their indices as values.
2. Iterate through the array `nums` and for each element:
   - If the element is not already present in the `map`, add it to the `map` with its index.
3. Create an array `result` of size 2 to store the indices of the two numbers.
4. Iterate through the array `nums` again and for each element:
   - Calculate the complement `temp` by subtracting the current element from the `target`.
   - If the complement exists in the `map` and its index is different from the current index, we have found the required pair.
   - Store the current index and the complement's index in the `result` array.
   - Break out of the loop since we have found the required pair.
5. Return the `result` array containing the indices of the two numbers.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input array `nums`. We iterate through the array twice, once to populate the hashmap and once to find the complement.
- Space complexity: $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input array `nums`. In the worst case, all elements in the array are distinct, and we store them all in the hashmap.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        int[] result = new int[2];
        
        // Populate the hashmap with array elements and their indices
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (!map.containsKey(nums[i])) {
                map.put(nums[i], i);
            }
        }

        // Find the complement and store the indices in the result array
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            if (map.containsKey(complement) && i != map.get(complement)) {
                result[0] = i;
                result[1] = map.get(complement);
                break;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```
