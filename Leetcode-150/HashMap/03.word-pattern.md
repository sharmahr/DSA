[Word Pattern](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-pattern/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

# Intuition
The problem is to determine if a pattern matches the words in a string such that each character in the pattern corresponds to a unique word in the string and vice versa. My initial thought is to use a hash map to maintain the mapping between the characters in the pattern and the words in the string.

# Approach
1. **Split the String**: Split the input string `s` by spaces to get the individual words.
2. **Length Check**: If the number of words in the split string does not match the length of the pattern, return `false`.
3. **HashMap for Mapping**: Use a hash map to map characters from the pattern to the words.
4. **Iterate Through Pattern**: For each character in the pattern:
   - If the character is already in the map, check if the mapped word matches the current word. If not, return `false`.
   - If the character is not in the map, check if the current word is already mapped to another character (using `containsValue`). If it is, return `false`.
   - Otherwise, add the character and word to the map.
5. **Final Check**: If the loop completes without returning `false`, the pattern matches the string, so return `true`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$, where $$n$$ is the number of characters in the pattern. This is because we iterate through each character in the pattern once.
- Space complexity: $$O(n)$$, where $$n$$ is the number of unique characters in the pattern. This is due to the space used by the hash map.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean wordPattern(String pattern, String s) {
        String[] word = s.split(" ");
        if(word.length != pattern.length()) return false;

        HashMap<Character, String> map = new HashMap<>();
        for(int i = 0; i < pattern.length(); i++){
            char c = pattern.charAt(i);

            if(map.containsKey(c)){
                if(!map.get(c).equals(word[i])){
                    return false;
                }
            } else {
                if(map.containsValue(word[i])){
                    return false;
                }
                map.put(c, word[i]);
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
}
```
