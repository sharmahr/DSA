[Isomorphic String](https://leetcode.com/problems/isomorphic-strings/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

# Intuition
To determine if two strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic, we need to ensure that each character in `s` can be mapped to a unique character in `t` and vice versa. This mapping must be consistent throughout the strings. Initially, my thought is to use two arrays to track the most recent index of characters in both strings to ensure their mappings align properly.

# Approach
1. **Edge Case Check**: If the lengths of the two strings are different, they cannot be isomorphic, so return `false`.
2. **Tracking Indices**: Use two arrays `indexS` and `indexT` to store the most recent indices of characters in `s` and `t` respectively.
3. **Iterate Through Strings**: For each character in the strings:
   - Check if the last seen indices of the current characters in `s` and `t` are the same. If not, return `false`.
   - Update the indices of the current characters to the current position.
4. **Final Check**: If the loop completes without returning `false`, the strings are isomorphic.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$, where $$n$$ is the length of the strings. This is because we iterate through each character of the strings once.
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$, as the arrays `indexS` and `indexT` have a fixed size (200 elements) regardless of the input size.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isIsomorphic(String s, String t) {
        // Create arrays to store the index of characters in both strings
        int[] indexS = new int[200]; // Stores index of characters in string s
        int[] indexT = new int[200]; // Stores index of characters in string t
        
        // Get the length of both strings
        int len = s.length();
        
        // If the lengths of the two strings are different, they can't be isomorphic
        if(len != t.length()) {
            return false;
        }
        
        // Iterate through each character of the strings
        for(int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            // Check if the index of the current character in string s
            // is different from the index of the corresponding character in string t
            if(indexS[s.charAt(i)] != indexT[t.charAt(i)]) {
                return false; // If different, strings are not isomorphic
            }
            
            // Update the indices of characters in both strings
            indexS[s.charAt(i)] = i + 1; // updating index of current character
            indexT[t.charAt(i)] = i + 1; // updating index of current character
        }
        
        // If the loop completes without returning false, strings are isomorphic
        return true;
    }
}
