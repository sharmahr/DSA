[Minimum Absolute Difference in BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-absolute-difference-in-bst)

# Intuition
The problem asks for the minimum absolute difference between any two nodes in a Binary Search Tree (BST). In a BST, an inorder traversal visits nodes in ascending order. By performing an inorder traversal and comparing each node with its predecessor, we can find the minimum difference efficiently.

# Approach
1. Perform an inorder traversal of the BST.
2. During the traversal, keep track of the previously visited node.
3. For each node, calculate the difference between its value and the previous node's value.
4. Update the minimum difference if the current difference is smaller.
5. Continue the traversal, updating the previous node as we go.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n)
Where n is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node exactly once.

- Space complexity: O(h)
Where h is the height of the tree. This space is used by the recursion stack. In the worst case of a skewed tree, this could be O(n), but for a balanced BST, it would be O(log n).

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    int minDiff = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    TreeNode prevNode = null;

    public int getMinimumDifference(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return minDiff;
        inorderTraversal(root);
        return minDiff;
    }

    private void inorderTraversal(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) return;
        inorderTraversal(node.left);
        if (prevNode != null) {
            minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, Math.abs(node.val - prevNode.val));
        }
        prevNode = node;
        inorderTraversal(node.right);
    }
}
```
